<p class="p2 noindent">This history of the war services of the Royal Irish regiment has been written
at the request of the officers of that very distinguished corps. When I
accepted the task, I knew that I had undertaken a delightful but difficult
piece of work, for it is no easy matter to do justice to the achievements of
a regiment which has fought in Europe, in Asia, in Africa, in America, and in
Australasia. After serving with credit in William III.’s war in Ireland, the
Royal Irish won undying laurels in the Siege of Namur in 1695. They
formed part of the British contingent in the army commanded by Marlborough
in the Low Countries and in Germany, and fought, not only at the
great battles of Blenheim, Ramillies, Oudenarde, and Malplaquet, but in the
long series of desperate but now forgotten sieges by which fortress after
fortress was wrested from the French. A detachment took part in the
defence of Gibraltar in 1727: the whole regiment was involved in the
disasters of the campaign of 1745: the flank companies encountered foemen
worthy of their steel at Lexington and Bunker’s Hill. In the first phase
of the great war with France the Royal Irish were in the Mediterranean:
they served in the defence of Toulon; they helped Nelson and Moore to
expel the French from Corsica, and they were sent to the mainland of Italy
where for some months they established themselves firmly at Piombino, a
port on the Tuscan coast. A few years later they fought under Abercromby
in Egypt, but then their good luck changed, for they were ordered to the
West Indies, where they remained till the end of the Napoleonic war.</p>

<p>In 1840, the outbreak of the first war with China re-opened the gates of
the Temple of Janus to the XVIIIth; and during the last sixty years almost
every decade has seen the regiment employed on active service, for after the
Chinese war came the second war in Burma; the Crimea; the Indian Mutiny;
the New Zealand war; the second Afghan war; the campaign of Tel-el-Kebir;
the Nile expedition; campaigns on the north-west frontier of India; and the
war with the Dutch republics in South Africa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>The Historical Committee had hoped that Field-Marshal Lord Wolseley
would have written a preface to the history of the regiment, with which
throughout his military career he has been associated closely. In Burma
he won his spurs leading a charge of infantry among whom were many of
the Royal Irish; as an acting Engineer at the siege of Sebastopol he frequently
supervised the operations of the regiment in the trenches; in the
Tel-el-Kebir campaign and the Nile expedition the Royal Irish formed part
of the troops under his command; and for the last thirteen years he has
been their Colonel-in-Chief. Ill health unfortunately has prevented Lord
Wolseley from writing at any length, but in a letter to the Chairman of
the Committee, he expressed his admiration for the regiment in the following
words:&mdash;</p>

<p class="right fs80">“<span class="smcap">Hampton Court Palace, Middlesex</span>,<br />
<span class="padr4"><em>19th June 1910</em>.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Gregorie</span>,&mdash;I am indeed very glad to hear that the History
of the Royal Irish Regiment is soon to be published. Its story cannot fail
to be a fine one. Every soldier who like myself, had the honour of fighting,
I may say shoulder to shoulder with it, will read this new work with the
deepest interest.</p>

<p>Were it to be my good fortune to lead a Storming party this afternoon
I should indeed wish it were to be largely composed of your celebrated
corps.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="padr30pc">Believe me to be,</span><br />
<span class="padr10pc">Very sincerely yours,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Wolseley</span>.”</p>

<p class="fs80">“<em>To</em> General <span class="smcap">C. F. Gregorie, C.B.</span>,<br />
<span class="pad4">Royal Irish Regiment.”</span></p>

<p class="p1" />
<p>A lithographic reproduction of this letter will be found facing <a href="#LTR">page viii.</a></p>

<p>This history has been prepared, not for the officers alone but for all ranks
of the Royal Irish, and the Committee are supplying it to non-commissioned
officers and private soldiers at a price so low that even the last joined recruit
can buy it, and read of the gallant deeds of his predecessors in the regiment.</p>

<p>As I am fully impressed with the importance of recording the names,
not of the officers only, but of all members of the regiment who on active
service laid down their lives for their country, I have tried to mention in
the <a href="#APPENDIX_2">Casualty appendix</a> all ranks who were killed, or died from the effects
of wounds or sickness in the many wars in which the Royal Irish have
taken part. In the campaigns of the seventeenth and the greater part of the
eighteenth centuries but few names are to be found, and it is not until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
middle of the nineteenth century that those of wounded non-commissioned
officers and men can be traced. In other appendices are lists of those who
won medals for distinguished conduct in the field, and also those to whom
medals for long service and good conduct have been awarded.</p>

<p>It has been my object to write this book as far as possible on the lines
of a biography, and by quotations from regimental sources of information
to let the Royal Irish describe their doings in their own words. In the
wars of William III. and of Anne this was comparatively easy, for though
the regiment has preserved no official records for the 17th and 18th centuries,
during the first thirty years of its existence it produced four military
historians, three of them officers, one a sergeant. Brigadier-General Kane,
Captain Robert Parker, and Sergeant John Millner have left books, and
Brigadier-General Robert Stearne a manuscript journal describing the events
they witnessed. Unfortunately they all wrote for a public far more concerned
in the general results of a battle or a siege than in the doings of
an individual regiment; and though they gave excellent accounts of an
engagement, they failed as a rule to describe the part played in it by the
men under their command. Whether their laconic style was due to modesty&mdash;for
the three officers were all distinguished soldiers&mdash;or to want of descriptive
power, it is impossible to say, but the fact remains that they have
bequeathed to their successors in the Royal Irish accounts singularly deficient
in regimental detail. In some cases they failed to record the casualties
among the XVIIIth in a battle or a siege, and when they remembered to
do so, often forgot to give the names of killed or wounded officers. Their
indifference to the losses of the lower ranks is characteristic of all armies
in the 17th and 18th centuries; and they tell us nothing of the deaths by
disease, or of the drafts of recruits by which the waste of war was made
good. Sergeant Millner is equally unenlightening. If, instead of devoting
his undoubted talents to the production of a sort of Quartermaster-General’s
diary of Marlborough’s movements, he had written an account of the life of
the regiment on active service, he would have left behind him a very
interesting book, instead of a comparatively dull one.</p>

<p>The adventures of the XVIIIth in the campaign of 1745 in the Low
Countries were described in the journal of one of the officers, whose name
has not been preserved. For a hundred years the regiment produced no more
authors, until, after the end of the first Chinese war, Lieutenant A. Murray
wrote an interesting account of the Royal Irish in that campaign.</p>

<p>For the wars in the beginning and middle of Queen Victoria’s reign much
valuable material was obtained from private sources by the honorary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
secretary of the Historical Committee, Lieutenant-Colonel A. R. Savile, who
for many years devoted himself to the collection of information from officers
who had served with the regiment in these campaigns. Probably no one
but the man who has profited by Colonel Savile’s exertions can appreciate
adequately the energy and perseverance he displayed in this labour of love
for his regiment. He has also prepared two appendices; <a href="#APPENDIX_9">one giving</a> an
epitome of the services of the Colonels of the regiment, <a href="#APPENDIX_10">the other</a> describing
the memorials which have been raised by the officers and men of the Royal
Irish to the memory of those of their comrades who died on active service.
Nor is this all for which I have to thank him: his collection of historical
matter relating to the regiment at all periods of its existence has proved of
great help to me:&mdash;indeed in all honesty I may say that if this book meets
with success a great part of that success will be due to the “spade work,”
the results of which Colonel Savile has generously placed at my disposal.</p>

<p>Many of the past and present officers of the Royal Irish regiment have
given me great assistance in the later campaigns by preparing for me
statements recording their personal recollections, and by lending me their
diaries and letters, written at the seat of war; and several non-commissioned
officers have supplied me with interesting details about episodes in South
Africa.</p>

<p>With the officers who form the Historical Committee I have worked
in perfect harmony and identity of views, and I have to thank them warmly
for the unfailing support they have given to me during the two years which
it has taken me to prepare this book.</p>

<p>I have to express my sense of obligation to the Librarians of the War
Office, the India Office, the United Service Institution, and the Royal
Colonial Institute, and the officials at the Record Office for their friendly
help.</p>

<p>To Mr Rudyard Kipling the warm thanks of the regiment are due for
his kindness in allowing the reproduction of his ballad on the second battalion
of the Royal Irish in the Black Mountain campaign.</p>

<p>In the compilation of this record very many books have been consulted.
Among them stands out pre-eminently the ‘History of the British Army,’
by the Hon. John Fortescue, who, by his masterly descriptions of the campaigns
he has dealt with up to the present, has made the path of a regimental
historian comparatively smooth.</p>

<span class="fs55">THE RAISING OF THE REGIMENT: AND THE WARS OF WILLIAM III.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">The Royal Irish regiment was raised on April 1, 1684, by Charles II., when
he reorganised the military forces of Ireland, which had hitherto consisted of
a regiment of foot guards and a number of “independent” troops of cavalry
and companies of infantry maintained to garrison various important points
in the island. Charles formed these independent troops and companies into
regiments of horse and foot; and as many of the officers had seen service on
the Continent in foreign armies, and a large number of the rank and file were
descendants of Cromwell’s veterans, Arthur, Earl of Granard,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> when granted
the commission of colonel in one of the newly raised infantry regiments, took
command not of a mob of recruits with everything to learn, but of a body of
soldiers of whom any officer might be proud. Of the corps thus raised all but
one had an ephemeral existence. During the struggle between James II.
and William III. for the possession of Ireland some followed the example of
the foot guards, joined the Stuart king in a body, and then took service
in France, while others broke up, officers and men ranging themselves as
individuals on the side of the monarch with whose religious or political views
they were in sympathy. The one bright exception was the regiment formed
by Lord Granard, which under the successive names of Forbes’, Meath’s,
Hamilton’s, the Royal regiment of Foot of Ireland, the XVIIIth, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Royal Irish regiment, has earned undying laurels in every part of the
world.</p>

<p>Though brought over to England to help in the suppression of Monmouth’s
rebellion against James II., Granard’s took no part in the operations by which
the rising was crushed at Sedgemoor, and in the autumn of 1685 returned to
Ireland,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> where evil days awaited it. With James’s attempt against the
liberties of his English subjects it is not the province of a regimental historian
to deal; but it is necessary to explain that the King, desiring ardently to own
an army upon which he could count to obey him blindly in the political
campaign he was planning, proposed to drive from the Colours all officers and
men upon whom he could not rely implicitly to carry out his schemes. He
decided to begin operations in Ireland, where he gave the Earl of Tyrconnel
unlimited power to remodel the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">personnel</i> of the troops. In 1686, Tyrconnel
summarily dismissed from many regiments all the Protestants in the ranks,
whom he stripped of their uniforms and turned penniless and starving upon
the world. The officers fared little better: two of Granard’s captains, John
St Leger and Frederick Hamilton, were “disbanded” solely on account of
their religious beliefs. As a protest against these proceedings Lord Granard
resigned his commission, to which his son Arthur, Lord Forbes, was appointed
on March 1, 1686. Next year the regiment “underwent a further purge,”
thus described by Brigadier-General Stearne,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> who was then one of Forbes’s
officers. “Tyrconnel made a strict review of each troop and company,
wherein he found a great many descendants of the ‘Cromelians,’ as he termed
them, who must turn out also, and took the name of every man who was to
be of the next disbandment, so that every soldier of an English name was
marked down. As soon as the camp broke up and the army returned into
winter quarters, most of the officers as well as soldiers were disbanded, and
only a few kept in for a while to discipline those that supplied their places.”
Tyrconnel rid himself of about four thousand of all ranks, or considerably
more than half the Irish army; the men he replaced with peasants, good
in physique but without discipline or training, while the officers he appointed
were of a very inferior class, who in the war of 1690-91 failed in many cases
to turn to good account the splendid fighting qualities of their soldiers. It is,
however, only fair to Tyrconnel’s memory to mention that while he thus
reduced the efficiency of the Irish army, he increased its power of expansion
by devising a short service and reserve system by which many thousand men
could be recalled to the Colours in case of need.</p>

<p>Thanks to the political influence and strong personality of Forbes, a “bold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
and daring man,” who had learned the trade of war first in the army of France
under the great Turenne, and later in a campaign against the Turks in Hungary,
the regiment in the general ruin suffered less than any other corps. In
defiance of Tyrconnel, Forbes succeeded in retaining more of his old officers
and soldiers than any other colonel, and in 1688, when the regiment, 770
strong, was ordered to England to meet the invasion threatened by the Prince
of Orange, it still contained a number of good officers, sergeants, and old
soldiers, whose united efforts had welded into shape the mass of recruits
recently poured into its ranks. For the next few months the strain upon
these veterans must have been great, as they had to keep the young soldiers
in order in a country where Irish troops at that time were looked upon with
deep suspicion and hostility by the people, and not as now heartily welcomed
by all classes. After being stationed for some time in London the regiment
marched to Salisbury, where James had concentrated his troops to meet the
Prince of Orange; and when the King, deserted by his generals, statesmen,
and courtiers, abandoned his army and fled to France, Forbes kept his men
together and returned to the neighbourhood of London, where he was
quartered at the village of Colnbrook, near Hounslow. From the Prince
of Orange, who by this time was actually, though not yet legally, King of
England, Forbes received orders to disband the Roman Catholics of his
regiment, and after five hundred officers and men had been disarmed and
sent to Portsmouth <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> for the Isle of Wight, several officers, many
sergeants, corporals, and drummers, and about a hundred and thirty private
soldiers, remained with the Colours.</p>

<p>Soon after this turning of the tables the regiment had an experience,
probably unique in military history&mdash;an examination in theology, in which
all ranks passed with high honours. The adventure is thus described in
Stearne’s journal:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A report spread through the whole kingdom that the Irish were
murdering, burning and destroying the whole country, insomuch that
there was not one town in the whole nation that had not an account
they were committing all these cruelties in the very next town or village
to them. Sir John Edgworth, who was our major, commanded the
regiment at this time (Lord Forbes being with the Prince of Orange in
London); he was quartered at Lord Oslington’s house near Colnbrook,
and upon the first of this flying report, sent for all the regiment to repair
immediately to his quarters where there was a large walled court before
the door, in which he drew them up with the design to keep them there
until this rumour was over, but the country people, hearing that an Irish
regiment was there, came flocking from all parts to knock us on the
head: but Sir John bid them at their peril, not to approach, and told
them we were not Irish Papists but true Church of England men; and
seeing among the crowd a gentleman, called to him and desired he would
send to the minister of the parish to read prayers to us, and if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
minister did not convince them we were all of the Church of England, we
would submit to their mercy. The minister was soon sent for, and to
prayers we went, repeating the responses of the Liturgy so well and so
exactly that the minister declared to the mob he never before heard the
responses of the Church of England prayers repeated so distinctly and
with so much devotion, upon which the mob gave a huzza, and cried
‘Long live the Prince of Orange,’ and so returned home.”</p></div>

<p>In February 1689, the regiment was re-equipped,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and in anticipation of
the recruits who in a few months began to refill its depleted ranks, weapons were
issued for its full establishment. Five hundred and seventy-nine men were to
be armed with flint-lock muskets and bayonets, while two hundred and forty
were still to carry long pikes for the protection of the musketeers against
cavalry on the battlefield and on the march. The pike, however, was a dying
weapon, and was soon superseded completely by the bayonet. No mention is
made of hand-grenades, though these missiles were already carried by the
grenadier company, composed of men chosen from their comrades in the
regiment for height, strength, and courage.</p>

<p>During the winter of 1688-89 Lord Forbes resigned his commission, on the
ground that having sworn allegiance to James II. he could bear arms for no
other king during his old master’s lifetime.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> For a few weeks Major Sir
John Edgworth replaced him, but owing to financial scandals compromising to
himself and several of his subordinates he was obliged to retire,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and Edward,
Earl of Meath, was appointed to the vacancy on May 1, 1689, when William
III. completed his arrangements for re-officering the regiment, which was
numbered the Eighteenth of the infantry of the line. He issued forty-one
new commissions, some to the seniors who had escaped disbandment at
Tyrconnel’s hands, others to officers who had been expelled from the army
during James’s reign, others again to young men with no previous military
experience. The names of the officers are given in the footnote.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the results of the revolution by which James II. was deposed and
William and Mary placed upon the throne was to plunge England into the
vortex of Continental politics. As Prince of Orange, William had been the
moving spirit in the coalition of States formed to curb the ambition of the
French king, Louis XIV., who throughout his life strove to aggrandise
himself at the expense of his neighbours; and when James II. took refuge
in France, Louis saw his opportunity to strike a heavy blow at William. By
long and careful attention to his navy he had made it superior to the
combined fleets of the English and the Dutch&mdash;the great naval powers of
the time&mdash;and, thanks to his command of the sea, was able to land James at
Kinsale with five thousand excellent French soldiers to give backbone to
the forty thousand men collected by Tyrconnel in anticipation of his Royal
master’s arrival. So slow was communication in those days that, though
James disembarked at Kinsale in March 1689, the news of the invasion did
not reach England for several weeks, when William had already despatched
most of his best troops to swell the forces of the Allies facing the French in
the Low Countries. William hurriedly raised more regiments, but it was not
until August that Marshal Schomberg, the veteran selected for the command
of the expedition, landed near Belfast, where in a few days he was joined by
Meath’s<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> regiment, which for some months had been quartered in Wales.
The army was sent to Ireland utterly unprepared to take the field. There
was no transport, the commissariat was wretched, the artillery was short of
horses; guns, muskets, and powder, food, clothing, and shoes alike were bad.
No wonder, therefore, that after taking the town of Carrickfergus, Schomberg
refused to give battle to James, and fell back upon an entrenched camp at
Dundalk to await reinforcements of every kind. Before the autumnal rains
set in the General ordered his troops to build themselves huts, and the
foreigners in William’s pay&mdash;old warriors, who had bought their experience in
many campaigns&mdash;worked with a will; but the English regiments, composed
of lazy, careless, and ignorant recruits, whose officers were no better soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
than their men, would not take the trouble to run up shelters or dig trenches
to drain their camping-grounds. Fever soon broke out with appalling results.
Out of the 14,000 troops assembled at Dundalk, 1700 died on the spot, 800
perished on the waggons in which the sick were carried to the coast, 3800
died in the hospitals of Belfast. The losses in the XVIIIth regiment are
not known, but from Schomberg’s confidential report on the troops under his
command it seems to have suffered less than other corps. Writing on
October 23, 1689, the Marshal says: “Meath’s (18th Foot), best regiment
of all the army, both as regards clothing and good order, and the officers
generally good. The soldiers being all of this province, the campaign is not
so hard on them as on others.”</p>

<p>Early in November James gave up the attempt to entice Schomberg out
of his entrenchments and went into winter quarters. The Marshal promptly
followed his example, holding the country between Lough Erne and Belfast
with a chain of fortified posts, and establishing his headquarters at Lisburn,
where the XVIIIth was placed in charge of his personal safety. The staff
of the regiment must have been hard-worked in the spring of 1690, for
recruits streamed in so fast that in June it was nearly the strongest corps
in the British army, standing on parade six hundred and seventy-eight
officers and men. For several months there was constant skirmishing along
the line of outposts; but no movements of importance took place until June,
when William III. arrived at Carrickfergus with two hundred and eighty-four
transports and many vessels laden with stores. Though this great mass of
shipping was escorted by a ludicrously small squadron of only six men-of-war,
it was not attacked on the voyage, for the French had neglected to send a
fleet to cruise in the Irish seas, thus leaving the line of communication across
St George’s Channel uninterrupted. When the reinforcements brought by the
King had landed, the army in Ireland reached the respectable total of about
37,000 men, of whom 21,000 were British, and the remainder Huguenots,
Dutch, and Danes&mdash;continental mercenaries whom William had imported to
lend solidity to his recently raised English regiments.</p>

<p>The French officers in James’s army had repeatedly urged him to retire into
Connaught and defend the line of the Shannon, but on political grounds he
declined to accept this excellent advice, and after some manœuvring took up
a position on the river Boyne, near Oldbridge and Duleek. Here he entrenched
himself, but on the 1st of July William attacked and routed him
with considerable loss. As the XVIIIth regiment played no important part
in the engagement, if, indeed, it came under fire at all, it is only necessary
to say that though some of James’s troops fought with distinguished gallantry
in this battle, others did not show the fine qualities they exhibited
later at Limerick and Aughrim. Covered by a rear-guard of Frenchmen, the
defeated army fell back upon the Shannon. James, for the second time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
deserted his soldiers and fled to France, while William occupied Dublin, and
matured his plans for the next phase of the campaign. By a great victory
over the Anglo-Dutch fleet at Beachy Head the King of France won for the
moment the absolute command of the British Channel, and thus could throw
reinforcements at will into the south and west of Ireland by the ports of
Waterford, Cork, Kinsale, Limerick, and Galway. These towns were, therefore,
essential to William; and hardly less important was Athlone, the
entrance to the wild districts of Connaught, to which he hoped to confine
the future operations of the war. A strong detachment under General
Douglas was therefore sent against Athlone, while William himself led
the greater part of his army towards Limerick, where a large number of
James’s troops had been concentrated. Though these regiments had worked
hard to improve the fortifications of the city, its defences were still so
imperfect that when the French heard that William was approaching they
pronounced the place to be untenable and moved off to Galway, leaving the
Irish, about 20,000 strong, to defend it, under the command of General
Boisleau, an officer who had learned to appreciate the good qualities of
his allies, and Sarsfield, an Irish soldier of great brilliancy and courage.
Reinforced by Douglas, whose detachment had failed to make any impression
on Athlone, William appeared before Limerick on August 9, and after
brushing away the enemy’s skirmishers pitched camp within a quarter
of a mile of the city wall, expecting little resistance from a place so weak
that the French had declared it “could be taken by throwing apples at it.”
In eight days William opened his batteries, though with very inferior
ordnance, for by a daring raid Sarsfield had swooped on the convoy bringing
up his siege-train and destroyed nearly all his heavy guns. On the 20th the
grenadiers of the XVIIIth and Cutts’s regiments greatly distinguished themselves
by the capture of a strong redoubt near John’s Gate. A sudden rush
from the trenches brought them to the foot of the work, into which they
hurled a shower of hand-grenades, and then scrambling over the parapet
under heavy fire, dislodged the defenders with the bayonet. As it was
known that the redoubt had an open gorge, a quantity of fascines had been
collected in the trenches, with which the grenadiers filled up the gap, and
then held the redoubt against a determined sally until they were relieved by
other troops. The affair cost the victors two hundred and seventy-one killed
and wounded; but though it is known that the grenadiers suffered heavily,
the only casualty recorded in the XVIIIth is the death of Captain Needham,
who was killed by a random shot at the end of the engagement.</p>

<p>This success was followed by the capture of another outlying work;
the trenches were pushed close to the walls, and six batteries played upon
the defences, which, near John’s Gate, began to crumble under the bombardment.
This breach William determined to assault, though he was warned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
by some of his officers that Limerick was not yet sufficiently shaken to be
stormed. According to many historians, his reasons for hurrying on the
attack were that his supply of ammunition was running low, and that with
the example of Dundalk before him, he could not venture to expose his
troops to the terrible rains which had set in. “At times the downpour
was such that the men could not work the guns, and to mount fresh batteries
soon became an impossibility: the trenches were knee-deep in mud:
the soldiers were never dry from morning till night and from night till
morning: sickness, which had been prevalent in the camp before, increased
to a plague: the tenting ground became a mere swamp, and those who
could afford it kept down the overwhelming damp only by burning bowls
of spirits under the canvas.”<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> On the 27th the breach appeared to be
practicable, and William ordered Douglas to deliver the assault. Half the
grenadiers of each regiment, five hundred men in all, were to lead, supported
by the XVIIIth and five other infantry corps: on the left of the main attack
was another column of infantry: and drawn up in rear stood a strong force
of cavalry. At half-past three in the afternoon the grenadiers dashed out of
the trenches, hurled themselves against the palisade of the counterscarp, and
carried it after fierce fighting; then, gaining the covered way, they dropped
into the ditch, scrambled up the breach, and pursued its defenders headlong
into the town. So far all had gone well: the impetuous valour of the
grenadiers had carried all before it, and victory was within William’s grasp,
when a mistaken interpretation of orders ruined the day’s work. The supporting
infantry should have followed the grenadiers up the breach, but,
allowing themselves to be drawn into pursuit of some of the enemy along the
covered way, they left the grenadiers without reinforcements. When the
defenders saw that no more troops were pressing up the breach, they rallied,
and, excited by witnessing the destruction of one of William’s foreign battalions
by an accidental explosion, they drove the remnants of the grenadiers
back into the covered way. If the failure to carry the breach was to be
redeemed even partially, it was essential that the covered way should remain
in the attackers’ hands, and round this part of the fortifications raged a
fierce fight, in which both sides showed splendid courage; but, after three
hours’ indecisive combat, Douglas found that his men had used nearly all
their ammunition, and drew off to camp with a loss of at least five hundred
dead and a thousand wounded. In this unsuccessful assault the XVIIIth
suffered severely;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> more than a hundred sergeants, corporals, and “sentinels”
(as private soldiers were then termed) were killed or wounded, and, though
the officers of the regiment who left accounts of this war are not agreed as to
the exact casualties among the commissioned ranks, it appears certain that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
six were killed and eight wounded.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Though all their names have not been
recorded, it is known that Captain Charles Brabazon, Lieutenant P. Latham,
and <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Ensign . . . Smith'">Ensign &mdash;&mdash; Smith</ins> were killed; Lieutenant-Colonel G. Newcomb (or
Newcomen) died of his wounds, and Colonel the Earl of Meath, Lieutenants
R. Blakeney and C. Hubblethorne, were wounded.</p>

<p>Dispirited by his reverse, William raised the siege, ordered his army into
winter quarters, and after handing over the command to Ginkell, a Dutch
general, returned to England after a campaign in which he had scored only
one marked success&mdash;the victory at the Boyne. He had failed to capture
Athlone and Limerick, and, with the exception of Waterford, all the ports in
the south and west were still open to the French navy. In September,
however, the arrival of Marlborough with an expedition from England improved
the situation: Cork and Kinsale surrendered, and thus the harbours
of Limerick and Galway alone remained available for the enemy’s operations.
Ginkell’s first step was to establish himself on a line which, starting
at Ballyshannon in the north-west, ran through Enniskillen, Longford, Mullingar,
Cashel, and Fermoy to Castletown-Berehaven in the south-west. The
regiment was ordered to Mullingar, where it passed the winter&mdash;very unpleasantly,
according to Stearne, who states that, “in the month of December
our garrison being reinforced by several regiments of Horse and Foot,
marched towards the enemy’s frontier, where after having fatigued the troops
for upwards of three months in this bad season of the year in ravaging and
burning the country we returned to our quarters.”</p>

<p>Ginkell opened the campaign of 1691 by an attack on Athlone, a town
built on both sides of the Shannon, and enclosed by walls, not in good
condition but still by no means to be despised. On the right or Connaught
bank a grim old castle frowned down upon a stone bridge, the only permanent
means of communication across the river, for though there was a ford
it was practicable only in very dry weather. After a short cannonade, Ginkell
breached and stormed the defences on the Leinster side of the river, and,
driving the enemy before him across the bridge, made himself master of the
eastern half of Athlone. But now his real difficulties began. Batteries
bristled on the bank above the ford; the guns of the castle commanded the
bridge, which was so narrow that a few men could hold it against a regiment;
and General St Ruth, a French officer of great experience, from his camp
hard by could reinforce the garrison without hindrance from the besiegers.
Ginkell rapidly threw up batteries, and opened so vigorous a fire with fifty
guns and mortars that one side of the castle crumbled away and the houses
on the Connaught bank were knocked to pieces. But until he had crossed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
river he could not close with his enemy; his pontoons were far behind him,
and he had no transport to bring them to the front; and the defence of the
bridge was so stubborn that he gained ground there only a few inches at a
time. St Ruth scoffed at the idea of the place being in serious danger,
decrying Ginkell as an old soldier who ought to know better than to waste
time and men on a hopeless enterprise. “His master,” he said, “ought to
hang him for trying to take Athlone, as my master ought to hang me if
I lose it.” But the Dutch general determined to ascertain if the river was
fordable, and, in the words of Stearne, instead of calling for volunteers,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“promised three Danish soldiers who lay under sentence of death, their
lives and a reward if they would attempt fording the river, which they
gladly accepted, and at noonday put on armour, and entered the river a
little below the bridge, and went at some distance from each other; the
enemy took them for deserters, and we from our trenches fired seemingly
at them, but over their heads at the enemy; when they had passed the
depth of the water, and almost on the other side, they turned back, which
when the enemy perceived they fired at them as hard as they could, but
our cannon which was reserved for that purpose, as also our small shot,
fired so briskly upon them that they could not hold up their heads to
take aim at the men, by which they were saved, two being only slightly
wounded. The General finding the river fordable (which it had not
been for many years) resolved to try and pass it, upon which he gave
orders for 40 Grenadiers from each company and 80 choice men out
of each Battalion of the whole army to march as privately as possible
into the trenches, and the whole army to be under arms to sustain the
attack should there be occasion.</p>

<p>“On the 20th June<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> the detachments marched into the trenches (I
being one of the Captains who commanded ours) with all the privacy we
could, but notwithstanding all our caution, St Ruth had notice of our
motion and design by the appearance of crowds of people on the hills to
see the action, upon which he marched down his whole army to the bank
of his part of the town, and filled the Castle and trenches with as many
men as it could well hold; our General perceiving this, put off the attack
till another time, ordering our detachments back to Camp, but at the
same time gave private orders that not a man should stir from his
Regiment, or be put on any other duty, but to be all ready at a minute’s
warning. St Ruth seeing us draw off, was persuaded that our General
dare not pass the River at this time, and in this security marched his
Army back to Camp, leaving only a slight body of men to guard their
works and the Castle. The next day a soldier of our Army (whether sent
by the General, or he went of himself, I can’t say) went over to the
enemy and was carry’d before St Ruth, and told him that the common
report in our Camp was that the General finding it was not practicable to
pass the River at this time resolved to try what he could do at Banagher
which lay ten miles down the River, and that everything was getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
ready for the march. St Ruth, easily persuaded with this notion, and
finding all things very quiet in our Camp, made a splendid entertainment
for all the Ladies and Gentlemen, the Officers of the Town, and the Camp.
The same day, being 22nd June, our General sent private orders along
the Line for all the detachments to march directly into the trenches, and
to keep under all the cover they could, at the same time he posted
several sentries on the hills to prevent anybody appearing to the enemy.
About 3 o’clock, when St Ruth was at the height of his merryment,
we began the attack by jumping into the River, and whilst we were
wading over, our Cannon and small shot played with great fury over our
heads on the enemy, insomuch that they did us but little hurt in passing,
and when we got over they made but little or no resistance but fled
immediately.</p>

<p>“At the same time we jumped into the River, part of our detachments
attacked the Bridge, and laid planks over the arch that had been
broken down upon our taking the first town, so that before St Ruth had
any account of our design we were in possession of the town; however
he marched his army down to try if he could force us back again, but he
committed a grand error which he found out too late, and that was
leaving the works at the back of the town stand, which became a fortification
against himself, for had it not been for this, we should never
have been able to maintain the town against his army, as we were not in
possession of the Castle. When St Ruth found there was no forcing us
back without a formal siege he returned to his camp, and those in the
Castle seeing him march off immediately surrendered at discretion, and
next day very early St Ruth decamped and marched off with great
precipitation. In this action we had only 27 men killed, and about as
many wounded, and not one Officer of note hurt.”</p></div>

<p>Ginkell now proposed to take the town of Galway and then turn southwards
against Limerick, but before this plan could be put into execution it
was necessary to dislodge St Ruth from the strong defensive position he had
taken up near Ballinasloe, where he was determined to fight a pitched battle
in the hope of retrieving the reputation he had lost on the banks of the
Shannon. His left rested on the castle of Aughrim, a few miles south of Ballinasloe;
his right was marked by the village of Urachree; his centre ran along
the slopes of a green and fertile hill, well suited for counter-attacks by horse
and foot. Much of the ground he occupied was surrounded by bogs, crossed
by a few tracks, of which only two were fit for cavalry, while all were under
the fire of his guns. Between the foot of the hill and the bogs were many
little patches of cultivation enclosed by hedges and ditches, some of which St
Ruth levelled to allow his cavalry free movement, while he left others intact
in order to give cover to his marksmen, to break the enemy’s formations, and
to conceal the movement of his troops upon the field of battle. The infantry
held the centre; the cavalry were on the flanks with a strong reserve in rear
of the left under Sarsfield, who had specific instructions not to move without
a distinct order from St Ruth himself. On July 11, the armies, each about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
20,000 strong, were within touch, but owing to a heavy fog it was not until
the afternoon of the 12th that the battle began with a sharp skirmish, which
revealed to Ginkell the strength of St Ruth’s position, and convinced him that
his only hope of success lay in turning the enemy’s left. He accordingly
made a feigned attack upon the Frenchman’s right, launched the remainder of
his infantry against the centre and left, and sent his cavalry to force their
way past the Castle of Aughrim. The troops directed against the centre
were to halt when they had crossed the bog, and on no account to push on
until the column on their right was safely over the quagmire and the cavalry
had turned the enemy at Aughrim. But when the soldiers, after floundering
thigh-deep in mud and slime, reached firm ground they got out of hand,
and forgetting their orders rushed forward, carrying everything before them
until a sudden charge of cavalry swept them backwards in confusion, while
the column for which they should have waited was still struggling in the
bog. When this supporting column, of which the XVIIIth regiment formed
part, had scrambled through the quagmire and re-formed its ranks, it moved
towards the hill over a part of the field apparently deserted by the enemy,
but really filled with sharpshooters, who, hidden in hedges and ditches,
with admirable coolness held their fire until the leading companies were
within twenty yards of them. Then a storm of bullets smote the head of
the column; men dropped in scores, and for a moment the advance was
checked, but the troops quickly rallied, and hurling themselves against the
first hedge carried it against a resolute defence. Hedge after hedge, ditch
after ditch, were charged and won, but by the time the last obstacle was
surmounted the infantry had fallen into great confusion: the regiments
“were so intermingled together that the officers were at a loss what to do,”
and at that moment St Ruth’s cavalry came thundering down upon them.
Under this charge the disorganised infantry gave way, and were being driven
backwards into the bog, when St Ruth’s horsemen were themselves assailed
in rear by some of Ginkell’s cavalry, who, after a daring march and still
more daring passage of a stream under the walls of Aughrim Castle,
reached the battlefield in time to save the foot soldiers from annihilation.
During this cavalry combat occurred an interesting instance of the value
of steady barrack-square drill. Throughout the winter of 1690-91 the
infantry had been practised in regaining its formation rapidly after a
charge, and now, when relieved from the pressure of the enemy, the battalions
re-formed with comparative ease, and then attacked along the whole line.
At this moment victory trembled in the balance, for though the losses on both
sides had been heavy, the defenders, on the whole, had had the best of the
day, and in Sarsfield’s strong body of cavalry they possessed a reserve
which had not yet been called into action. Had Sarsfield then struck into
the battle his troopers might have turned the scale, but he was fettered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
by his instructions not to move except on St Ruth’s own order, and St
Ruth, struck down by a stray cannon-ball, was lying a headless corpse
upon the ground. The absence of the French general’s directing hand was
soon felt, though his death was concealed as long as possible; and when
the attacking infantry began to gain ground steadily, and the cavalry
turning movement was fully developed, the men who for hours had so
valiantly defended their position lost heart and began to fall back in disorder.
Then their discipline failed them, and they broke, rushing in panic
towards Limerick and Galway, with Ginkell’s cavalry and dragoons spurring
fiercely after them.</p>

<p>The losses in this battle were very heavy. In William’s army 73 officers
were killed and 109 wounded; of the other ranks 600 were killed and 908
wounded. The XVIIIth escaped lightly: only one officer, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Captain . . . Butler'">Captain &mdash;&mdash;
Butler</ins> was killed; a major, a captain, and two subalterns were wounded;
among the non-commissioned officers and men seven were killed and eight
wounded.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> On the subject of the casualties in the army commanded by
St Ruth historians differ widely; but 7000 appears to be the number fixed
upon by those least given to exaggeration. Whatever the actual figures
were, however, there can be no doubt that James’s soldiers were so completely
routed that in their retreat they strewed the roads with their
discarded weapons. A reward of sixpence was offered for every musket
brought into Ginkell’s camp; in a short time so many waggon-loads were
collected that the price was reduced to twopence, and great numbers of
firearms still came in.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The dispersal of St Ruth’s army was the death-blow
to the Stuart cause: Galway made little resistance, and though the
garrison of Limerick fought stoutly for a month it was obliged to surrender
on October 3, 1691. The French officers were allowed to return
to their own country, accompanied by those of James’s soldiers who wished
to enter the French army, and with their departure ceased all organised
opposition in Ireland to the rule of William III., who was thus free to
transfer his troops to the Low Countries.</p>

<p>The regiment, however, did not go abroad at once. After wintering at
Waterford it was ordered in the spring of 1692 to Portsmouth, to reinforce
the garrison of England against an invasion threatened by Louis XIV.,
and after the French fleet had been beaten at the battle of Cape La
Hogue the XVIIIth was one of the regiments selected for a raid against
the seaport towns of France; but the coast proved so well guarded that it
was impossible to land, and the transports sailed to the Downs and thence
to Ostend, where the troops disembarked and marched towards the towns
of Furnes and Dixmude, which the French evacuated without waiting to
be attacked. While employed in strengthening the walls of Dixmude the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
XVIIIth had a curious experience: there was an earthquake, so violent
that the soldiers thought the French were blowing up the place with
hidden mines, while the Flemish peasants, who were working as navvies,
became paralysed with terror and declared that the end of the world was
come. In a few weeks the greater part of the troops re-embarked for
England, but not all reached land in safety, for a great storm scattered
the transports, several of which went to the bottom. The XVIIIth regiment,
however, was fortunate enough to escape all loss.</p>

<p>In the course of the winter Lord Meath retired,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and was succeeded in
the colonelcy by Lieutenant-Colonel Frederick Hamilton; Major Ormsby
became Lieutenant-Colonel, and Captain Richard Stearne was promoted to
the Majority. In 1693, the regiment, which now was known as Frederick
Hamilton’s, was turned for a few months into a sea-going corps.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In May, 1693, we marched to Portsmouth, and embarked on board
the Grand Fleet, commanded by three joynt Admirals (viz., Sir Ralph
Delaval, Sir Cloudesley Shovel, and Admiral Killigrew) when we served
this summer as Marines. Our rendezvous was Spithead; in June we
sailed to Torbay, where we waited for the Fleet which was to go
under the command of Sir George Rooke who had twenty Men of War
to convoy them up the Mediterranean. About the latter end of June
Sir George joyned us, and the whole Fleet set sail together, and was
looked upon to be the greatest that had been in one sea for many years;
there being in all with Men of War and Merchantmen, English and Dutch,
near 800 sail: the Men of War with their tenders stretching in one line
between the Coast of France and the Merchantmen. The Grand Fleet
kept Sir George company till they passed the Bay of Biscay, being the
utmost limits of our Admirals’ orders, notwithstanding they very well
knew that the French Fleet had sailed out of Brest, and was lying
before them to intercept Sir George. Yet their orders were such that
they dare not sail any farther, but then parted and returned to Torbay.</p>

<p>“The French, who never wanted intelligence from our Courtiers,
had an exact account to what degree our Grand Fleet had orders to
convoy Sir George, therefore lay by with their Grand Fleet about
eighteen hours sail beyond the limit of our Grand Fleet; they upon
first sight believed that our Grand Fleet had still kept Sir George
company, which put them into such a consternation that for some
time they stood away, which gave Sir George an opportunity of making
signals to his Merchant ships to shift for themselves and make the best of
their way back, whilst he with his Men of War sailed after them in very
good order. As soon as the Enemy discovered their mistake they
made all sail they could after him, but Sir George, keeping astern of
his Merchant ships, made a running fight of it, by which means he
saved his whole fleet except a few heavy sailers which were picked
up by their Privateers.</p>

<p>“After this the French Fleet made the best of their way to Brest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
and the account coming to our Court, orders were sent to the Grand
Fleet to sail immediately in quest of them, upon which our Admirals
sailed immediately to Brest to try if they could get there before the
enemy, but in vain, for they had got in several days before we left
Torbay. This affair being over we returned to our port, and in
September the Land Forces were put on shore. Our Regiment was
landed part at Chatham and part at Southampton, and joyned at
Norwich in October. In December we marched to London, and were
reviewed in Hide Park by the King; two days after we embarked
at Red House, and sailed for Flanders and landed at Ostend in December
1693.”<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p></div>

<p>The regiment was now to play a distinguished part in the war with
France, which with a breathing space of five short years lasted until 1712.
With the exception of the campaign of 1704 in Germany, the fighting in
which the XVIIIth was concerned took place chiefly in the country now
called Belgium, but then known as Flanders.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Its soil was fertile, and cultivated
by a large and industrious population. Its numerous cities were
celebrated throughout Europe for the wealth of their traders, whose merchandise
was carried to the sea over a network of canals and navigable
rivers. Every town was walled, and the whole country was studded with
fortresses, with many of which the regiment was to become well acquainted
in the course of the next twenty years. On the French side of the frontier a
chain of forts stretched from Dunkirk to the Meuse, and Louis had further
strengthened his border by a great line of field-works, in the hope of making
an invasion of France impossible. In a country so highly fortified the war
necessarily became one of sieges. Each side tried to breach the other’s
line of defences by capturing fortresses. There were ceaseless marches and
counter-marches, and gigantic attempts to relieve the besieged strongholds,
met by equally strenuous efforts to prevent the relieving forces from fulfilling
their mission. Flanders, however, was by no means the only part of Europe
affected by the war, for sooner or later the French armies invaded nearly
every country unfortunate enough to be within their reach. To describe the
whole of Louis’s struggle for supremacy, and to explain the means by which
he induced some of the Allies to abandon the coalition and range themselves
on his side, would be far outside the scope of a regimental history. It is
enough to say that though the conflict raged from the shores of the North
Sea to the south of Spain, where a few thousand British soldiers served for
several years, it was in Flanders that Marlborough won most of his splendid
victories over the French.</p>

<p>The XVIIIth’s first campaign on the Continent&mdash;for the few weeks spent
at Dixmude in 1692 cannot be dignified by this name&mdash;was uneventful.
There were no great battles, and the only operation of importance was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
siege of Huy, where the regiment was employed with the covering force. In
the spring of 1694 the order of precedence among the regiments of the British
army was settled in a way very displeasing to Hamilton’s officers and men,
who ever since the camp at Dundalk had claimed for their corps the numerical
position due to its having been raised in April 1684.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Kane chronicles the
decision in a few words.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A Dispute arose about the Rank of our Regiment in particular, which
were (<em>sic</em>) regimented 1 April 1684 from the old Independent Companies in
Ireland, and had hitherto taken Rank of all the Regiments raised by King
James the Second, but now those Regiments disputed Rank with us: the
King referred the Affair to a Board of General Officers; and most of
them being Colonels of those Regiments, would not allow us any other
Rank than our first coming into England, which was some time before
the King landed, when he came over Prince of Orange on the Revolution,
by which we lost Rank of eleven Regiments, taking Rank after those
raised by King James, and before all those raised by King William. The
King thought the General Officers had acted with great Partiality, but as
he had referred the Affair to them, he confirmed it.”</p></div>

<p>The whole question of precedence was re-opened in 1713, and the colonel
of the XVIIIth made a strong effort to obtain rank for the regiment from the
date of its formation in 1684, but without success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>When William III. took the field in 1695, he commanded an army of
124,000 men, composed of contingents from England, Holland, Denmark, and
many of the German States. The British numbered about 29,000, and as the
King employed them on every occasion when desperate courage and bull-dog
tenacity were needed, it is clear that, however much he despised the English
politicians who intrigued against him with Louis XIV., he appreciated his
British soldiers at their true worth. As his object was the recapture of the
fortress of Namur, taken by the French three years before, he began a series
of manœuvres designed to decoy Marshal de Villeroi, the French Commander-in-Chief,
so far into the western half of the theatre of war that the Allies
would be able to dash upon Namur and invest it before their intention was
discovered. William was so far successful that he was able to surround the
fortress on June 23, but not before the French had thrown in strong
reinforcements under Marshal de Boufflers, who took command of the garrison
of thirteen or fourteen thousand excellent troops. The citadel stands on a
rocky height at the end of the tongue of land formed by the junction of the
rivers Sambre and Meuse. The town is built on the left bank of the Sambre;
and in the fortification of both citadel and town the highest military art had
been displayed&mdash;first, by the Dutch engineer Cohorn, who planned and built
the works; and later, by his French rival Vauban, who had extended and
improved them so greatly that Namur was now considered to be impregnable.
A hundred and twenty-eight guns and mortars were mounted on its walls,
and its arsenals and storehouses were well supplied in every way. On June
28th, William began his trenches, and five days later opened fire upon the
town, which after desperate fighting surrendered on July 24, one of the
conditions being that the garrison should be allowed to retire into the citadel
with full power to take part in its defence.</p>

<p>During this, the first phase of the siege, the XVIIIth was part of the
covering detachment of 20,000 men with which the Prince de Vaudemont,
one of William’s trusted lieutenants, protected the operations of the besiegers
so successfully that during several weeks he engrossed the attention of the
French Commander-in-Chief’s vastly superior force of 90,000 troops. Before
quoting Kane’s interesting account of the way de Vaudemont “sparred for
time,” it must be explained that the French were in no hurry to relieve
Namur, where they thought de Boufflers could hold his own indefinitely. De
Villeroi accordingly marched against de Vaudemont, who had entrenched
himself on the river Lys, nine or ten miles south of Ghent; but</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“finding him stand his Ground, he proceeded with the more Caution, and
halted about two Leagues short of him, till he had sent to Lille for some
Battering-Cannon. This took up some Time which was what Vaudemont
wanted to keep him in Play till the King could fix himself before Namur.
At length Villeroy advanced within less than half a League of us, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
finding the Prince still keep his Ground, ordered a great many Fascines
to be cut in order to attack us early next Morning. He also sent
Lieutenant-General Montal with a strong Body of Horse round by our
Right, to fall in our Rear, and cut off our Retreat from Ghent, which was
three Leagues in the Rear of us. Now the Prince had three trusty
Capuchin Fryars for his Spies, one of whom kept constantly about
Villeroy’s Quarters, who found Means to inform himself of all his
Designs; the other two plied constantly between both Camps without
ever being suspected, who gave Vaudemont an Account of everything.
Now the Prince having drawn Villeroy so near him, thought it high Time
to make his Retreat; he therefore, as soon as Villeroy appeared, sent off
all the heavy Baggage and Lumber of the Camp to Ghent, and about
Eight in the Evening he ordered part of the Cavalry to dismount and
take the Intrenchments, and the Infantry to march privately off with
their Pikes and Colours under-hand, lest the Enemy should discover us
drawing off; and as soon as it grew duskish the Cavalry mounted and
marched after the Foot. Soon after Villeroy’s Advance-Guard finding
our Works very quiet, ventured up to them; who finding the Birds fled,
sent to acquaint the General; on which they marched after us as fast
as they could. Montal, who by this time had got into our Rear, finding
us marching off, thought to have fallen on our Flank; but Sir David
Collier, with two Brigades of Foot, gave them so warm a Reception, that
they were obliged to retire with considerable Loss. Next Morning all
our Army got safe under the Works of Ghent, at which Time the Enemy’s
Horse began to appear within a Mile of us; whereupon we past the Canal
that runs from thence to Bruges, along which a Breast-Work had been
thrown up.... Vaudemont had now a very difficult Part to act in
Defence of this Canal against so powerful an Army. Villeroy marched
immediately down to the Canal, where, for upwards of three Weeks, by
Marches and Countermarches he harassed our small Army off their Legs;
however, he could not make the least Movement, or form any Design, but
the Prince had timely Notice of it; which was very surprising if we
consider the Canal that was between us, so that the French said he dealt
with the Devil.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Villeroy finding he could not pass the Canal on the
Prince, at length turned towards Dixmude, where the Prince could give
no manner of Assistance; here he succeeded beyond his most sanguine
Expectations.”</p></div>

<p>After an easy victory at Dixmude, which the Governor surrendered
without firing a shot, de Villeroi turned towards Brussels, where the wealth
of the citizens promised much loot to his soldiers; but here he was again
foiled by de Vaudemont, who out-marched him and took up a position
which saved the city from capture, though not from a savage and unnecessary
bombardment. After his artillery had devastated a large part of
Brussels, de Villeroi drew off to await orders from Paris, thus giving the
covering detachment the opportunity of joining hands with the main army
before Namur, where William was assiduously battering the citadel with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
hundred and thirty-six heavy guns and fifty-eight mortars, whose fire
towards the end of the siege cost de Boufflers three hundred men a day.
On the 10th of August, the XVIIIth and three other British regiments
were transferred to the besieging force, to replace corps shattered in the
earlier operations, and at once began duty in the trenches. A few days
later de Villeroi advanced, hoping to defeat William in a pitched battle,
and thus to relieve the garrison which he had so long neglected, but he
found the King so well posted and the covering army so heavily reinforced
by the besieging troops that he did not venture to attack. While the French
Commander-in-Chief was beginning to realise that in leaving de Boufflers so
long unrescued he had made an irreparable mistake, William gave orders for
a general assault upon the citadel, where the works had been breached
in several places. During the night of the 19th, six thousand men from the
covering detachment filed into the trenches, where before daybreak they were
joined by the greater part of the besiegers. Seven hundred British grenadiers
and four regiments&mdash;the 17th,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> the XVIIIth, and Buchan’s and Mackay’s,
two corps which have long since disappeared from the Army List,&mdash;under the
command of General Lord Cutts, were to assault the work called the Terra
Nova; while the Bavarians, Hessians, Brandenburgers,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and Dutch were to
make simultaneous attacks on the other breaches. As the trenches could not
hold all the troops poured into them, the XVIIIth and Buchan’s were sent to
conceal themselves in the abbey of Salsine, about half a mile from the foot of
the Terra Nova breach.</p>

<p>At 10 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span> on August 20, the explosion of a barrel of gunpowder gave
the signal for the attack, and from Cutts’s trenches began to emerge the
red coats, to whom the most dangerous duty had, as usual, been entrusted;
four sergeants, each followed by fifteen picked men, led the column; the
grenadiers were close behind them; the 17th and Mackay’s followed in
support, with the XVIIIth and Buchan’s in reserve. It was a desperate
enterprise. Between the trenches and the Terra Nova was a stretch of
several hundred yards of ground&mdash;smooth, coverless, and swept by frontal and
cross fire, and before the grenadiers had crossed it they had left behind
them a long trail of killed and wounded. Owing to a mistake in the
organisation of the attack, the grenadiers and the 17th assailed the breach
before the other regiments were at hand to support them, and by the
time the XVIIIth came up the assault had been repulsed with heavy loss;
many of the officers had been hit, and Cutts, the idol of the troops, was
wounded and for the moment incapable of giving orders. Undismayed by
the confusion and depression around them, the Irishmen with a yell rushed
at the breach. At first they had to scramble over the bodies of those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
fell in the first attempt, but half-way up they reached the grenadiers’ high-water
mark, and thence struggled upwards over ground covered by no
corpses but those of the XVIIIth. From the neighbouring works they
were tormented by cross fire, but yet pushed on, to the admiration of their
foes who through the clouds of smoke watched them gradually winning
their way up the breach, the Colours high in air, despite the carnage
among the officers who carried them. Mad with excitement, determined to
win at all cost, the regiment by a splendid effort reached the top of the
breach, where the Colours were planted to show the King, who from a hill
behind the abbey eagerly watched the progress of his British troops, that
the Terra Nova was his. But as the men surged forward they found
themselves faced by a retrenchment undamaged by the bombardment. The
officers, holding their lives as nothing for the honour of their country and
their corps, led rush after rush against this retrenchment, but in vain.
They could not reach it; guns posted on the flank of the breach mowed
down whole ranks; infantry fired into them at close range. All that men
could do the XVIIIth had done, but nothing could withstand such a torrent
of lead; the second attack failed, and the remnants of the regiment were
driven backwards down the breach, and then charged by a counter-attack
of horse and foot which the French let loose upon them.</p>

<p>Shaking themselves clear of the enemy, the survivors fell back towards
the spot where Cutts, on resuming the command after his wound was
dressed, had ordered his broken regiments to reassemble. While the British
were retreating they learned that the Bavarians had not fared much better
than themselves; badly led, they had missed their proper objective, the
breach in a work called the Coehorne, and had attacked the covered way
at a spot where the garrison was in great force; and after two hours’
hard fighting they reported that unless help came at once they could not
hold their ground. Cutts, who from his love of a “hot fire” had earned
for himself the nickname of the Salamander, instantly determined to go to
the rescue of the Bavarians, and halting, turned towards the Coehorne and
re-formed his column. To the onlookers it seemed impossible that troops
fresh from the costly failure at the Terra Nova would face another breach,
but Cutts knew what British soldiers could do, and his call for volunteers
for a forlorn hope was answered by two hundred men, who headed this
fresh attack, followed by Mackay’s, with the XVIIIth and the other regiments
behind them in support. The assault was successful; the covered
way was seized and held by the British, and all along the line victory
smiled upon the Allies, who by five o’clock in the afternoon were lodged
solidly within the enemy’s works.</p>

<p>To reward the XVIIIth for the magnificent courage it showed at the
Terra Nova the King formally conferred upon it the title of the Royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Regiment of Foot of Ireland, with the badge of the Lion of Nassau and
the motto “Virtutis Namurcensis Præmium.”<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> In the year 1832, the Royal
Irish received the somewhat belated official permission to emblazon this
motto on their Colours; and it was not until 1910, two hundred and fifteen
years after the capture of the fortress, that the regiments who took part
in the siege were allowed to add Namur to their battle honours. In
these matters our Government does not move with undue haste; it was
only in 1882, that the Royal Irish were granted leave to commemorate on
their Colours the fact that they had shared in the glories of Blenheim,
Ramillies, Oudenarde, and Malplaquet, the last of which was won in
1709!</p>

<p>The distinctions given by William were dearly earned, for though the
authorities differ as to the actual numbers of the casualties in the XVIIIth,
all agree that they were enormous. According to the army chaplain
D’Auvergne, who wrote one of the best accounts of William III.’s wars in
Flanders, the regiment lost twenty-five officers and two hundred and
seventy-one non-commissioned officers and men. Parker and Kane give
the same figures, but as both these officers were severely wounded it is
probable that the returns had been sent in long before they came back
to duty, and that in their books they adopted D’Auvergne’s numbers without
investigation. In Stearne’s unpublished journal he states that twenty-six
officers (whose names he does not mention) and three hundred and
eighty of the other ranks were killed or wounded; and as Stearne was
one of the few senior officers left with the regiment on the evening of the
20th of August, he must have had every opportunity of knowing the exact
numbers. Two theories have been advanced to explain this discrepancy:
the first, that Stearne included in his total all who were wounded, while
the other historians took count only of the men who were gravely injured
and admitted into the base hospital at Liege; the other is that among his
four hundred and six casualties were the officers and men hit in the
trenches after the XVIIIth joined the besieging army and before the day
of the assault, or in other words that his figures show the regiment’s
losses during the whole of the siege. But even taken on the lower, and
therefore safer estimate, the percentage of loss is astonishingly high. At the
beginning of a campaign a regiment was seldom more than 600 strong;
indeed, many historians consider that 500 was the average strength. Since
the XVIIIth had taken the field in June it had done much marching and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
some work in the trenches, so that Hamilton’s ranks cannot have been
quite full when he gave the order to storm the breach; but assuming that
Hamilton had with him about 600 men, more than 49 per cent, or very
nearly half the regiment, were killed or wounded on August 20, 1695.
If the strength be taken at 500, the percentage shows that about six men out
of every ten were hit; while if Stearne’s casualties are adopted the percentage
is 81, more than eight men killed or wounded out of every ten
who went into action. As it is impossible to ascertain definitely the strength
of the XVIIIth, or to pronounce on the accuracy of the rival chroniclers,
it is enough to say that the regiment suffered more heavily than any of
the other British corps in Cutts’s column, whose losses, including those of
the grenadiers, amounted at the least to thirteen hundred and forty-nine
officers and men.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>In the XVIIIth Lieutenant-Colonel A. Ormsby; Captains B. Purefoy,
H. Pinsent, and N. Carteret; Lieutenants C. Fitzmorris and S. Ramme;
Ensigns A. Fettyplace, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: ' . . . Blunt'">&mdash;&mdash; Blunt</ins>, H. Baker, and S. Hayter were killed.
Captain John Southwell, Ensign B. Lister (or Leycester), and an officer
whose name cannot be traced, died of their wounds. Colonel Frederick
Hamilton; Captains R. Kane, F. Duroure, H. Seymour, and W. Southwell;
Lieutenants L. La Planche, T. Brereton, C. Hybert (or Hibbert), and A.
Rolleston; Ensigns T. Gifford, J. Ormsby, and W. Blakeney were wounded.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>The result of the assault convinced de Boufflers that he could not resist a
renewed attack, and early on the 22nd he made signals of distress to de
Villeroi, who finding it impossible to relieve him, retired to Mons, leaving
the garrison of Namur to make the best terms it could. De Boufflers
accordingly ordered his drummers to beat the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chamade</i>, the recognised
signal that a fortress desired to parley with the enemy, and after two or
three days’ negotiations surrendered: the troops were to be allowed to
return to France, the citadel, artillery, and stores remaining in the hands
of the victors. On the 26th, the French, reduced by the two months’ siege<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
to less than five thousand effectives, marched out with all the honours of
war&mdash;drums beating, Colours flying, and arms in their hands&mdash;and after
filing through a double line of the allied troops were escorted to Givet,
the fortress to which they had safe conduct. With the fall of Namur the
campaign of 1695 virtually came to an end, for though there was some
marching and counter-marching nothing came of these manœuvres, and
the Allies went into winter quarters early in the autumn.</p>

<p>The campaigns of 1696 and 1697 were spent in operations unproductive of
any affairs of importance, and the finances of all the combatants were so
much exhausted by the strain of this long war that peace was signed at
Ryswick in September of the latter year. The British contingent was
sent to Ostend to await ships from England to take them home, and on
December 10, the XVIIIth sailed on an adventurous voyage, thus described
by Stearne.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The ship I was in, with one more, having got near the Coast of
Ireland, there came up with us a Sallee Man of War of about 18 guns,
carrying Zealand colours.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> When the master of our ship saw her bearing
down upon us, he called up all the Officers and told us what danger
we were in of being made slaves for ever. We thought it a very hard
case after getting over so many dangers as we had gone through, upon
which we all resolved to die rather than be taken, and having got all
our men to arms, we made them lye close under the gunnel, that
they might not discover what we were, and called to the other ship,
and told them that in case she boarded us, that then they should lay
her on board the other side, and that we would do the like in case
they boarded them; and our Seamen were to be all ready with ropes
to lash us together as soon as they laid us on board. At the same
time we were to jump into her, and so take our fate. By the time
she came up with us we had got everything ready to put our design
in execution, but she fell in the wake of us, we being much the larger
ship, and hailed our Master to go on board her, who answered that
he would not leave his ship, and so kept on his course. The Sallee
Man of War kept us company about an hour, and was once, as we
thought, coming up to board us; however, she thought better of it,
fell astern, and stood off without firing a shot, being prevented by the
wind which blew very fresh, so that they could not put a gun out
of their ports.</p>

<p>“This affair had not been long over when we made the Land, but
it put our Master in such a fright, that he went quite out of his
course, so that the Old Head of Kinsale which was the first land we
made, he took to be the Highlands of Dungarvon, which made him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
stand away to the Southward, instead of directly in to the Shore,
untill our Master was quite got out of his knowledge, and night
coming on we were obliged to stand out to sea, the wind rising till it
blew a storm, insomuch that we were in great danger of foundering
at sea in an old rotten ship. Next morning we stood in towards the
shore, the wind still continuing very high, and not a soul on board
knew where we were, and though we made signals of Distress, yet
the wind was so high that no boat dare venture out to our relief,
and had it not been for one of our Lieutenants who had been formerly
in the West Indies, and who remembered something of the Coast, we
should certainly have perished the night following; by his directions
we made shift to get into Bantry Bay before night, and very fortunate
it was, for that night the wind blew so violent that it was with much
difficulty our Ship could ride it out, with all the anchors and cables
we had. Next day, being the 24th December, we landed at Bantry,
and from there marched to Cork, where the other part of the Regiment
landed some days before.”</p></div>

<span class="fs55">MARLBOROUGH’S CAMPAIGNS IN THE WAR OF THE SPANISH SUCCESSION.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">Almost before the troops from Flanders had shaken down into their winter
quarters, the anti-military party in England raised the cry of “No standing
army” with such vigour that Parliament insisted on the disbandment of
many regiments; in each of the remainder three companies were entirely
suppressed, and the others cut down to a strength of two sergeants, two
corporals, a drummer, and thirty-four private soldiers, while officers at the
rate of one for every ten men were allowed to remain with the Colours.
In 1701 war again broke out on the Continent. This war, known as that
of the Spanish Succession, was but a sequel to the conflict ended at Ryswick,
and was again caused by Louis XIV.’s determination to conquer the best part
of Europe. Without waiting for a formal declaration of hostilities, Louis
struck hard and quick; and occupied the fortresses of Ostend, Nieuport,
Oudenarde, Ath, Mons, Charleroi, Namur, and Luxemburg, and nearly all
the strongholds on the Meuse from Namur to Venloo, thus threatening at
once the southern border of Holland and the keys to its south-eastern
frontier, the fortresses of Grave, Nimeguen, and Fort Schenk. The Allies
again took up arms; in June the XVIIIth and eleven other regiments were
sent off to Holland under Marlborough’s command; and Parliament decided
that England should furnish a contingent of forty thousand men, of whom
eighteen thousand were to be British and the remainder foreigners, taken
temporarily into our pay.</p>

<p>Before the English troops settled down into their winter quarters,
William III. reviewed the infantry, whose uniform was at that time both
comfortable and picturesque. They wore loosely-fitting red coats, cut long
enough to protect the thighs from wet and cold; waistcoats, visible when the
skirts of the coat were buttoned back to allow the legs free play in marching;
breeches with gaiters, buttoning high above the knee, and shoes. Their head-dress
was a cocked-hat, like that of a Chelsea pensioner, and their hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
was plaited in a pig-tail, which was plastered with powder and tied up with
bows.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 1702, the Allies discovered that though Louis had
echeloned considerable numbers of troops along the Rhine and the lower
Scheldt, his immediate object was to gain possession of the fortresses of
Grave, Nimeguen, and Fort Schenk: and a force of 25,000 men, among
whom were the XVIIIth and most of the other British regiments, was
assembled at Cranenburg, a few miles from Nimeguen, to watch a French
army, 60,000 strong, encamped some twenty miles to the southwards. In
the absence of Marlborough, who was detained at the Hague by diplomatic
business, the army on the Meuse was under the Earl of Athlone, as Ginkell
was now called: the French were commanded nominally by the Duke of
Burgundy, but really by de Boufflers, who accompanied this royal prince
as military adviser. The old Marshal had not forgotten his humiliation
at Namur in 1695; and finding out that Athlone’s intelligence department
and system of patrolling were equally bad, by a sudden swoop so nearly
surprised his camp that his troops had to abandon their camp and baggage
and hasten for shelter to Nimeguen, where their reception was the reverse
of cordial. The Governor was indignant with the Dutch Government for
having promoted Athlone over his head; he was suspected of having sold
himself to the enemy, and either from treachery or from the wish to see
his rival cut to pieces, shut the gates upon him as he approached the fortress,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
and refused to take any measures for its defence. The civilian
population, however, had no intention of surrendering; they broke open
the stores, dragged guns to the ramparts, carried up powder and shot
upon their backs, and opened so furious a fire that the French drew off in
disgust.</p>

<p>Marlborough, whose recent appointment as Commander-in-Chief of the
allied forces had created much ill-will among the Dutch generals, now joined
the army, and concentrated 60,000 men, of whom 12,000 were British, in the
neighbourhood of Nimeguen. Never was a general more sorely tried by
incompetent and jealous subordinates than Marlborough in this campaign.
He was comparatively an unknown man; he had never commanded a large
army in the field; many of his colleagues distrusted him, and took every
opportunity of thwarting his plans; and, above all, his footsteps were dogged
by two Dutch civilian officials, styled Field Deputies, who had power to
refuse him leave to employ the troops of Holland in operations of which they
did not approve. Four times, by rapid marches and skilful strategy, he
forced the French into positions where they could only fight at great disadvantage;
and four times was victory snatched from him by the obstinacy
of the Dutch leaders or the timidity of the Field Deputies. The campaign of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
1702, however, was by no means barren of results, for Marlborough was
allowed to recapture various fortresses on the Meuse. The first place to be
invested was Venloo: the Germans sat down before the south and east of
the town; to the Dutch and the British was allotted the attack on the
north and west, and, after three weeks’ hard work, the British brigade, of
which the XVIIIth formed part, sapped up to the foot of the glacis of Fort
St Michael, a strong outwork of the main fortress. Prince Nassau, whom
Marlborough had deputed to carry on the siege in his absence, then ordered
a lodgment to be made on the top of the glacis as a preliminary to a future
attack on the covered way. The whole of the XVIIIth moved into the
trenches early in the morning: about midday they were joined by three
companies of grenadiers and several hundred men from the other regiments
in the brigade; and in the course of the afternoon Lord Cutts called the
officers together, and, apparently on his own responsibility, enlarged the
orders originally issued. The British were not to be satisfied with making
a lodgment, but if they found the French “give way with precipitation, they
were to jump into their works and follow them, let the consequence be what
it would! ‘These were fine orders from a general,’ remarks Kane grimly,
‘but as inconsiderate as they were, we as inconsiderately and rashly followed
them.’”</p>

<p>At four o’clock the explosion of a barrel of powder gave the signal for the
assault; the artillery opened a heavy fire, and the British advanced. After a
short resistance, the French ran back to the covered way, followed by the
Royal Irish, who pursued them into a ravelin, where a captain and sixty men
fought gallantly till nearly all were disabled. The survivors rushed towards
a small wooden bridge, spanning a wet ditch eight or ten feet deep and a
hundred feet in width. The end of this bridge was made of loose planks;
and had the French done their duty when they crossed it, they would have
tossed these planks into the ditch, and thus made a death-trap, into which the
leading British soldiers as they followed them would have been thrust by
their comrades in rear. But in their panic the French forgot to take this
precaution; the XVIIIth got safely across, and chased the enemy to the foot
of the wall of the main fortification. The men were wild with delight at
their success, but the senior officers realised that the situation was a desperate
one: a few hundred British troops were entangled among the unbreached
works of a fort, whose garrison, though undoubtedly surprised, had suffered
but little in the attack. To retire was out of the question, but to scale the
wall looming high and grim above them appeared impossible, until the
fugitives, whom the soldiers were chasing with their bayonets, solved the
problem by darting to a part of the wall where much grass grew, and
hauling themselves up from tuft to tuft. Where a Frenchman could
climb an Irishman could follow, and after a desperate scramble, the red-coats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
began to mount the ramparts, when the enemy, utterly confounded by the
unconventionality of the assault, hastily retired into the body of the fort,
threw down their arms, and begged for quarter. Their lives were spared,
and the booty given to the troops. This capture cost the British two
hundred and ninety-seven killed and wounded.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The casualties among the
XVIIIth are not recorded.</p>

<p>Two days later the siege came to an end in a very curious way. To
celebrate a recent victory in another part of Europe, the Allies paraded all
their troops and marched close up to the town to fire a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feu-de-joie</i> into
it with shotted guns and muskets. The inhabitants had suffered much from
the bombardment, especially since the cannon of Fort St Michael had been
turned against them, and when they saw the movement, feared that the walls
were going to be stormed forthwith; some rushed to the Governor to urge
him to surrender, while others flocked to the ramparts with white cloths
in their hands, crying “Mercy, Mercy, Quarter, Quarter.” The Governor
asked to be allowed to capitulate, and, says Parker, “as we had other
sieges to carry on this season, the Prince allowed them honourable terms.”</p>

<p>Nassau next took the fortress of Ruremonde after a nine days’ siege,
and then joined Marlborough’s main army near Liege, an open town commanded
by a citadel and a smaller fort. When the French garrison heard
that the Allies were advancing, they sorrowfully exchanged their comfortable
billets in the houses of the burghers for the casemates of the forts; and as
soon as the enemy had left the town, the inhabitants sent a deputation to
Marlborough to offer him the city keys in token of submission, and to
entreat him to preserve Liege as far as possible from the horrors of war.
Cutts, with ten British regiments, was ordered to occupy the town, while
the rest of the army began operations against the forts. The siege, which
lasted eighteen days, ran its ordinary course: batteries were thrown up,
trenches were dug, outworks were captured, and when the gunners had
made a practicable breach the assault was delivered. Millner, in his quaint
language, tells us that though the French fought very well,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“the Allies after one Hour’s very hot and sharp Dispute beat the Enemy
from off the Breach, and entered the Fort amongst them with Sword in
Hand, killing all before them; and had killed all therein, had not the
French instantly thrown down their arms, and earnestly beg’d for
Quarter, which our People soon after granted, being always prone to
give Mercy, when Need most requires.... Much of the Honour of this
Action may be attributed to Lord Cutts’ good Conduct, in sending up
speedily an assistance of Twelve Hundred Men from the ten Battalions
in the Town, which suddenly rushed in on the side of the Citadel next
to the City, in the very greatest heat of the action, before the Enemy
was aware thereof, contrary to their Expectation; the which did very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
much surprize and daunt the Enemy, and made them quit the Breach
much sooner than could otherwise have been expected.”</p></div>

<p>Next day the smaller fort surrendered, and thus, on October 23, 1702,
Liege was recovered from the French at a cost of about twelve hundred
killed and wounded, of whom nearly half were British. Though none of
the regimental historians mention any casualties in the XVIIIth, it by no
means follows that there were none among the regiment, for Stearne and
Kane, Parker and Millner were all such confirmed fire-eaters that, as a rule,
they appeared to consider it beneath their dignity to mention any but very
heavy losses. The fall of Liege marked the end of the campaign, and the
British contingent marched back to Holland, where the XVIIIth again went
into quarters at Huesdon, the town where they had spent the winter of
1701-2.</p>

<p>The year 1703 brought no laurels to the British in Flanders. Dutch
incapacity and obstinacy again hampered Marlborough’s movements; he
failed to bring the French to battle, and accomplished little beyond the
retaking of a few small fortresses. At the sieges of two of these places,
Huy and Limberg, the XVIIIth was present. The regiment spent the first
part of the winter at Breda, then reinforced the garrison of Bergen-op-Zoom,
and afterwards returned to Breda, whence it sent a strong detachment to
Maestricht.</p>

<p>But if little of importance happened on the shores of the North Sea
during this campaign, great events took place in the south of Germany,
where the Elector of Bavaria had deserted the coalition and attached himself
to the fortunes of Louis XIV. The Gallo-Bavarians, as the troops of
the new alliance were called, captured several fortified towns belonging
to the Emperor of Austria, and defeated the Imperialists at the battle
of Hochstädt.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Encouraged by these successes, Louis evolved a plan of
campaign almost Napoleonic in its grandeur. Its main object was the
capture of Vienna. One army was to force its way from Italy through
the Tyrol to Austria; another was to march from Strasburg on the Upper
Rhine into South Germany, reinforce the 45,000 Gallo-Bavarians, and join
hands with the troops from Italy; while to harass Austria from the rear a
strong detachment was to be sent to Hungary to help the inhabitants in
their chronic rebellion against the Emperor. In Flanders de Villeroi was to
remain on the defensive, while on the Moselle 10,000 troops stood ready to
reinforce either flank.</p>

<p>On his side Marlborough had also conceived a daring scheme. As a
soldier, he saw clearly that a mere war of sieges would produce no decisive
results; as a politician, he saw equally clearly that the coalition would go to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
pieces unless Austria was delivered from the Gallo-Bavarian peril,&mdash;and he
decided that the best way of helping the Emperor was to leave to the
Dutch the defence of the Low Countries, and to carry the war into the heart
of Germany. As he knew that the Dutch would oppose his project to the
uttermost, he took only two or three of his officers into his confidence; he
wrung a reluctant consent from the Dutch Government to the withdrawal
of troops from Holland by pretending that he was about to attack the French
on the Moselle, and for several weeks after he had set his army in motion
the troops had no idea to which part of the Continent they were heading.</p>

<p>On May 19, 1704, Marlborough began his celebrated march; his force
included 16,000 British troops, among whom were the headquarter companies
of the XVIIIth, joined a few days later by the detachment from Maestricht.
Disregarding the protests of the Dutch and of the petty princelings whose
territories were being threatened by the French, he pushed resolutely forward,
and covering from twelve to fifteen miles a-day worked up the right bank of
the Rhine from Coblentz.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> As each of the French generals formed different
theories to account for Marlborough’s unexpected movement, they failed to
combine against him; on the 3rd of June he crossed the Necker, and then
turned south-east towards Donauwörth, a town on the Danube, which he had
decided to make his advanced base for the invasion of Bavaria.</p>

<p>On the 1st of July the Allies encamped at Amerdingen, and at three
o’clock next morning Marlborough marched upon his objective, fifteen miles
off. He rode with the advance-guard&mdash;thirty-five squadrons, three regiments
of Austrian grenadiers, and six thousand Continental and British infantry,
among the latter being a detachment of the XVIIIth, about a hundred and
thirty of all ranks.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> The main body of the army followed two hours later.
Pushing on with an escort of cavalry the Duke began his personal reconnaissance
about 9 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span>, and found that the town of Donauwörth lay in a
valley on the north, or left bank of the Danube, and was commanded by a
steep and flat-topped hill. This hill, the Schellenberg, was the key of the
position: the Gallo-Bavarians had connected it with the town by field-works,
and twenty-five hundred horse and ten thousand foot were encamped upon its
summit. During the day Marlborough learned that Louis XIV. had ordered
strong columns from Flanders and the Upper Rhine to move upon South
Germany; and his keen eyes detected on the farther bank of the river
preparations for the immediate reception of a large body of men. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
accordingly decided to attack the hill at once, without waiting for the
whole of his main body to come up: but owing to vile roads and broken
bridges it was not until six o’clock that the troops were formed for battle at
the foot of the slope, about five hundred yards in length, which led up to
the works on the north-west side of the Schellenberg. The infantry of the
advance-guard were drawn up in four lines, with the cavalry behind them in
two lines; eight battalions were in support, and an equal number were in
reserve. During the day the cavalry had made fascines, with which the
enemy’s ditches were to be filled up, and as soon as these great bundles of
faggots had been distributed among the infantry the advance began. Under
a cross fire of artillery, the columns breasted the hill without stopping to fire
a shot until they were within eighty yards of the entrenchments, when a
sudden outburst of grape and musketry made havoc among the crowded
ranks. For a moment the men recoiled before this hail of missiles; then
recovering themselves, they pushed on until their leaders reached a hollow
road, which in the excitement of the moment was mistaken for the ditch in
front of the works they were to storm. Before the blunder was discovered
the fascines had been thrown in, and consequently when the heads of the
columns reached the real ditch they had no means of crossing it, and were
exposed to such a hurricane of bullets and hand-grenades that when the
enemy made a furious counter-attack with the bayonet some of the troops
gave way. Three British regiments saved the situation;<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> they stood like
rocks; the partially broken corps rallied on them, and then after a hard
struggle drove back their gallant foes into their entrenchments.</p>

<p>A French officer who commanded one of the battalions that fought so
stoutly on the 1st of July, 1704, has left a lurid picture of the combat.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The English infantry led this attack with the greatest intrepidity,
right up to our parapet, but they were opposed with a courage at least
equal to their own. Rage, fury and desperation were manifested by both
sides, with the more obstinacy as the assailants and the assailed were
perhaps the bravest soldiers in the world. The little parapet which
separated the two forces became the scene of the bloodiest struggle that
could be conceived.... It would be impossible to describe in words
strong enough the carnage that took place during the first attack, which
lasted a good hour or more. We were all fighting hand to hand, hurling
them back as they clutched at the parapet; men were slaying, or tearing
at the muzzles of guns and the bayonets which pierced their entrails;
crushing under their feet their own wounded comrades, and even gouging
out their opponents’ eyes with their nails, when the grip was so close that
neither could make use of their weapons. I verily believe that it would
have been quite impossible to find a more terrible representation of Hell
itself than was shown in the savagery of both sides on this occasion.”<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>By dint of drawing men from the parts of the defences unthreatened by
the Allies, the Gallo-Bavarians were able to keep the troops on the north-west
of the hill at their full strength: and they repulsed the next assault so heavily
that it was found necessary to bring a large number of British cavalry into
the thick of the fire to support the shaken, though by no means beaten,
infantry. Our enemies were beginning to congratulate themselves on their
success, when the remainder of Marlborough’s main body came into action
against the west of the hill, where the works had been almost denuded of
their garrisons; they took these works with little loss, repulsed a charge of
cavalry, and then struck the Gallo-Bavarians in flank. About this time the
Allies made another attempt to carry the entrenchment, and were once more
beaten back. So serious did things look that the Scots Greys were ordered to
dismount and attack the works on foot; but maddened at the thought that
cavalrymen were called in to do the work which foot soldiers had failed to
accomplish, the infantry then made one final, desperate effort, and surged triumphantly
over the parapet from which they had been repulsed so often. Now
at length the French and the Bavarians, exhausted by their magnificent
defence, driven from their works in front and hard pressed in flank, gave
way; and their retreat soon degenerated into a rout, as they rushed towards
the river with all the allied cavalry thundering after them. The victory was
very complete: of the twelve thousand men who had watched the Allies form
for the assault not more than three thousand rejoined their regiments; the
remainder were killed, wounded, captured, or drowned in the waters of the
Danube; and thirteen standards, fifteen guns, and all the stores at Donauwörth
fell into the victors’ hands. But the success was dearly won, for
though the engagement lasted less than two hours, it cost the Allies more
than five thousand officers and men. The British, as usual, lost very heavily;
33 officers, among whom was a major-general, were killed, and 83 wounded;
420 “sergeants and sentinels” were killed, and 1001 wounded; in all 1537, or
“probably more than 33 per cent of the number engaged.”<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> To this total the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
XVIIIth, out of its detachment of 130 officers and men, contributed 51, or
nearly 40 per cent of its numbers. Captain M. Leathes, Ensigns J. Pinsent
(or Pensant), S. Gilman, and E. Walsh were wounded; 1 sergeant and 11 men
were killed; 3 sergeants and 32 men were wounded.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>After the loss of Donauwörth the Gallo-Bavarians fell back upon Augsburg,
where they encamped under the guns of the fortress. Marlborough was
not strong enough to attack them, and had to content himself with blockading
the town while he opened communications with the Elector of Bavaria, to
whom he offered tempting terms to abandon Louis and place his excellent
troops once more at the disposal of the Allies. The Elector spun out the
negotiations until he knew definitely that Marshal de Tallard was coming
from the Rhine to his help; then he broke them off suddenly, sending word
that he would sooner serve as a private soldier under the King of France than
as a general in the Emperor of Austria’s army. As Marlborough now learned
from Prince Eugene of Savoy, who commanded a detached force on the
Danube, that the French were manœuvring to cut off the allied army from its
base of supplies, he at once turned northward, and recrossing the Danube
joined hands with Eugene near Donauwörth. The situation had become very
serious, for though the immediate pressure on the Emperor of Austria was
removed, and the French had made no attempt to invade his territories from
Italy, it was essential to bring the Gallo-Bavarians to battle and defeat them
before further reinforcements had increased their strength, already greater
than that of the Allies. It was with much relief, therefore, that on the
morning of the 12th of August Marlborough discovered that the French and
Bavarians had moved down the left, or northern bank of the Danube, and
were then encamped near the village of Hochstädt, a few miles up stream
from his own camping-ground.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Their right flank was protected by the
Danube, here an unfordable river, and by the village of Blenheim, standing
two hundred yards from the water’s edge. The left rested on Lutzingen, a
hamlet at the foot of a chain of broken and thickly wooded hills, which
guaranteed it against a turning movement. Between these villages stretched
a plateau, white with long lines of tents; and along the whole of its eastern
front ran the shallow valley of a tributary of the Danube&mdash;the Nebel, a
formidable obstacle, for though the stream in itself was insignificant the
bogs and marshes through which it flowed were very difficult to cross, and
the side of the valley rose so gently towards the camp that it formed a natural
glacis, well suited to the movements of all arms. Between Blenheim and Lutzingen
were two other villages&mdash;Unterglau, on the eastern or far side of the
Nebel, was occupied as an advanced post; Oberglau, on the western or near
side, was part of the main line of defence. To hold this very strong position,
about four miles in length, de Tallard who commanded the Gallo-Bavarians
could dispose of an army from 56,000 to 60,000 strong, and sixty guns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Though de Tallard had risen to be a Marshal of France, he was by no means
a clever man, and by his mistakes at Blenheim he played into Marlborough’s
hands. He failed completely to fathom his adversary’s mind: because it was
the object of the French to starve the allies out of South Germany rather
than to expel them by force of arms, de Tallard did not want to fight a battle,
and it did not occur to him that Marlborough, with his inferior force of 52,000
men and 52 guns, might take the offensive. Again, in the disposition of his
troops he misinterpreted the military axiom of his period, which warned the
chief of an army encamped on ground where it might possibly become engaged,
to place his troops in the order in which they would be called upon
to fight. In drawing up an army the infantry was usually posted in the
centre of the line, with the cavalry on its flanks. To this normal or “sealed-pattern”
formation Tallard blindly adhered; but by treating his wings as
distinct units and not as part of a great army he produced much confusion;
in the centre of the whole line the cavalry of both wings met, but without
unity of command: and on each side of this mass of 10,000 horsemen were
infantry, with more cavalry on their outer flanks.</p>

<p>As soon as Marlborough had reconnoitred the enemy’s position he returned
to camp, and settled the outline of the plan of the battle which he intended
to force upon the French and Bavarians next day. As their flanks were
unassailable he decided to deliver a frontal attack along their whole line:
Eugene, with the right wing, was to assail the Elector and Marshal de Marsin,
who had made the villages of Lutzingen and Oberglau their respective headquarters;
the Duke was to carry Blenheim, where de Tallard had established
himself, and break through the enemy’s centre between that village and
Oberglau. The night was spent in marshalling the troops into their places
in the nine columns in which they were to move against the enemy, and
at two o’clock on the morning of August 13, 1704, Marlborough began to
advance. A thick white mist overhung the valley of the Danube, and
though it delayed his march, concealed his movements so effectually that
it was six o’clock before the French vedettes discovered that the Allies were
upon them; and when an hour later the mist lifted, de Tallard to his astonishment
saw a great army preparing to deploy on the far side of the Nebel, the
cavalry in the centre, the infantry on the flanks. While Eugene was marching
to the ground allotted to him, Marlborough’s troops took up their appointed
places. Opposite Blenheim, on the extreme left, stood a column under
General Cutts, consisting of fourteen British regiments and several German
corps: and on Cutts’s right was the remainder of the left wing, drawn up
in four lines, the first and fourth of cavalry, the second and third of infantry.
The Gallo-Bavarians, as soon as they had recovered from their
surprise, snatched up their arms and fell in before their tents; and when
de Tallard saw a mass of dull red uniforms at the head of the column threatening
Blenheim he realised that hard fighting was to be expected near the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
village, and crowded into it twenty-six regiments of his best infantry, who
were so tightly packed that large numbers of the soldiers did not fire a shot
throughout the battle. The French rapidly put Blenheim into a state of
defence&mdash;the walls were loopholed, the garden fences (or palisades as they
were called by the historians of the time) were strengthened; the entrances
were barricaded with carts, gates, furniture from the houses; while twelve
squadrons of cavalry, sent to hold the two hundred yards of ground between
the village and the Danube, entrenched themselves behind a “laager” of
waggons. Between Blenheim and Oberglau de Tallard drew up his cavalry
in two lines, with a third line in support, composed partly of horsemen,
partly of nine battalions of infantry whose steadiness was doubtful. Some
French writers say that these shaky troops were Piedmontese, taken
prisoners in Italy and forced to join Louis XIV.’s service.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> In the centre
de Marsin occupied Oberglau with a strong detachment; behind the hamlet
were posted his infantry and that of the Elector, and in front of Lutzingen
stood a strong body of cavalry.</p>

<p>While his troops were marching into their places the French Commander-in-Chief
added to his many mistakes that of abandoning to the Allies the
natural glacis already mentioned, and thus giving them a foothold on
which to re-form after they had crossed the Nebel. Parker shall tell the
story in his own words. While the Allies were preparing to deploy,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“the Elector, Tallard and Marsin went to the top of the steeple of
Blenheim, from whence they had a fair view of their army: the
Elector and Marsin were for drawing the Army, as close to the marshy
Ground they had in their Front as possible, and not suffer a man over
but on the Points of their Bayonets; but Tallard (a haughty proud
Frenchman) was on a different Opinion, and said, that would be no
more than making a drawn Battle of it: that the only way to get a
compleat Victory would be to draw up their army at some small Distance
from the Morass, and suffer us to come over, and the more there came
over the more they were sure to kill. Neither the Elector nor Marsin
could persuade him out of this Notion; they both were very much dissatisfied,
and dreading the consequence, left him, and went to their Posts.”<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p></div>

<p>Marlborough had formed for battle long before Eugene was able to do
so, for bad roads, broken ground, and many unexpected difficulties greatly
retarded the march of the right wing towards the left of the French line.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Until Eugene was prepared to attack, Marlborough could not advance without
running the risk of being crushed by vastly superior forces; and for several
hours his horse and foot were condemned to inactivity while his guns hotly
engaged those of the French, which were brought forward towards the Nebel,
and fired at every target within their range. The XVIIIth, as usual, must
have been well to the front, for Parker mentions that the first cannon-ball
“was aimed at our regiment, but it fell short; the second killed one man,
which was the first blood drawn that day.” After the Duke had carefully
inspected his batteries, he ordered the chaplains to read prayers at the head of
every regiment, and as soon as the Service was over, to satisfy himself that
all was well with his troops and to steady them under the enemy’s bombardment,
he rode slowly along the whole length of his line, exposing himself
with perfect calmness to the projectiles of the French. His extraordinary
talents, his charm of manner, his unfailing courtesy, his absolute indifference
to danger had already endeared him to the strangely mixed body of soldiery
under his command; and when by a miracle he escaped all injury from a
cannon-ball which struck the ground between his horse’s legs, a great
sigh of relief went up from the hearts of Britons and Danes, Germans
and Dutch.</p>

<p>It was not until twelve o’clock, four hours after the artillery duel had
begun, that an aide-de-camp galloped up to tell Marlborough that Eugene was
ready. Then the signal was given, and Cutts, on the extreme left of the
line, moved forward to the attack of Blenheim. Under a sharp artillery fire,
two of his brigades&mdash;one of British, under Row, the other of Hessians&mdash;succeeded
in crossing the Nebel near the village, and halted under cover
to re-form their ranks; then leaving the Hessians in support behind the bank
of the stream, Row’s five regiments advanced to the assault of a position held
by the cream of the French infantry. Until our leading ranks were within
thirty paces of the enemy not a shot was fired on either side. The British
had been ordered to carry Blenheim with the bayonet if possible, and in
no case to burn a cartridge until their General could actually touch the
palisades. The French waited till their assailants were so close to them that
the worst shot could not fail to bring down his man. Then so tremendous a
burst of musketry fell upon the head of the column that the French expected
to see the red-coats break and flee; but our men rushed forward through the
smoke, cheered on by Row, who succeeded in striking a palisade with his
sword before he fell mortally wounded. The British gave one volley, and
then attempted to storm&mdash;some tried to scale the palisades, others to pull
them down, while others again lunged fiercely through the loopholes at the
French marksmen, who fired so fast and straight that in a few minutes a
third of the brigade was killed or wounded, and the remainder were in
retreat, hotly pursued by a body of cavalry. Now followed some wild
fighting. The Hessians struck in with great gallantry, and recaptured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Colours which had been lost in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</i>; five British squadrons floundered
over the Nebel to the rescue of the infantry, and beat back the French
horsemen; but pursuing with more ardour than judgment, they were decoyed
under the fire of the infantry in Blenheim and suffered severely. The
French followed up their success by bringing up more batteries to sweep the
crossing of the Nebel by which the British had advanced; but Cutts soon
drove away this audacious artillery and, returning to the charge, delivered
a series of desperate but ineffectual assaults upon the village until Marlborough
ordered him to make no further efforts to storm it, but to fire volleys
into it so continuously that the French would be pinned to their defences,
and therefore unable to reinforce their right centre, which he was himself
attacking. Parker gives a quaint account of this phase of the battle. After
describing a gallant but fruitless assault, he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The rest of the Foot coming up, they renewed the charge; and those
that had been repulsed, having soon rallied, returned to the charge, and
drove the enemy from the skirts of the village, into the very heart of
it. Here they had thrown up an intrenchment, within which they were
pent up in so narrow a compass, that they had not room to draw up
in any manner of order, or even to make use of their arms. Thereupon
we drew up in great order about 80 paces from them, from which we
made several vain attempts to break in upon them, in which many brave
men were lost to no purpose; and after all, we were obliged to remain
where we first drew up. The enemy also made several attempts to come
out upon us: but as they were necessarily thrown into confusion in
getting over their trenches, so before they could form into any order
for attacking us, we mowed them down with our platoons in such
numbers, that they were always obliged to retire with great loss; and it
was not possible for them to rush out upon us in a disorderly manner,
without running upon the very points of our Bayonets.”</p></div>

<p>While this fierce combat was raging at Blenheim, Marlborough had succeeded,
though slowly and with great difficulty, in throwing a considerable
number of troops over the Nebel near Oberglau. In the morning the French
generals had sneered at the Duke for placing great bodies of infantry between
his first and second lines of horse; in the afternoon they discovered
that there was method in the Englishman’s madness. Foreseeing that the
cavalry would arrive on the far side of the stream with their horses blown
and their ranks broken, he sent a large number of battalions to lead the way,
with orders to push far enough up the enemy’s side of the valley to leave
room for the allied cavalry to re-form behind their fire. The French horsemen
charged down upon the disordered squadrons, but even where momentarily
successful they were forced ultimately to retire by the musketry of the
infantry, and failed to prevent Marlborough’s second line of cavalry from
crossing the Nebel. During this stage of the battle, eleven battalions of
Hanoverians attempted to capture the village of Oberglau, but were met by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
magnificent counter-attack of the Irish Brigade&mdash;the men who after the
surrender at Limerick had joined the army of the King of France. The
Irishmen annihilated two battalions, and smashed through the remainder of
the column; but then dashing on too far, were thrown into confusion by
a charge of cavalry, and finally driven back with great loss by the fire of
three fresh battalions which Marlborough threw against their flank.</p>

<p>On the right, meanwhile, things were not going well for the Allies. The
Elector, disregarding de Tallard’s order to keep the troops high up on the
slope, had moved his infantry right down to the edge of the broken ground
near the Nebel, and thus met Eugene’s men while they were scattered and
exhausted by the difficulties of the crossing; thrice did the Prince of
Savoy make a formidable attack upon the Bavarians, and thrice was he
beaten back. On the left, however, Cutts was fulfilling his mission admirably,
for his rolling musketry detained within the entrenchments of Blenheim
the enormous mass of infantry, whose presence on other parts of the field
might have turned the scale in favour of the French. But the fate of the
battle was to be decided in the centre, where Marlborough had now succeeded
in placing eight thousand cavalry in two long lines on the lower slope of
the natural glacis which de Tallard had abandoned so unaccountably to
his enemy. To meet this danger, the French Commander-in-Chief called
up the nine battalions which in the morning he had considered unfit to
use in the forefront of the battle, and posted them level with the first
line of his cavalry. The Duke met this move by bringing to his front
a battery and three battalions of Hanoverians, who engaged the French
infantry at short range, and so greatly shook them that they were unable
to withstand a charge of cavalry which swept them away, leaving a
huge gap in de Tallard’s line. That general now had to pay for the
vicious dispositions by which the cavalry in his centre had been posted
without proper arrangements for combined action. The horsemen of de
Marsin’s right wing played, not for the safety of the whole French army,
but for that of their own commander, and instead of flinging themselves
into the breach and presenting an unbroken front to Marlborough, wheeled
backwards in order to protect the flank of the column to which they belonged.
De Marsin had his hands too full to be able to spare a man to help de Tallard,
and before any of the infantry from Blenheim could come to the rescue
the Duke’s eight thousand troopers were charging up the slope; for a
moment the French cavalry stood, then seized with a mad panic they
wheeled about and galloped furiously for the river, riding down everything
they met in their haste to escape from the German horsemen, who
sabred hundreds of them and drove hundreds more into the Danube.</p>

<p>De Marsin and the Elector were in no condition to continue the battle
after the rout of Tallard’s wing; they retired in fair order, pursued by
Eugene’s troops. To turn their retreat into a rout Marlborough called off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
his Germans from the congenial task of cutting their enemies to pieces,
and sent them to fall upon de Marsin’s flank: but it was now late in the
evening; the Germans overtook not de Marsin’s column but Eugene’s; in
the growing darkness each side thought the other was the enemy and
halted to prepare to fight, and by the time that the mistake had been
discovered and mutual apologies presented and accepted the Gallo-Bavarians’
right wing had gained so long a start that further pursuit was hopeless.
The battalions in Blenheim were less fortunate, for the Allies blocked
every egress with cavalry, and called up infantry to storm the village,
when the luckless Frenchmen reluctantly agreed to surrender, and twenty-four
battalions of infantry and four regiments of dragoons laid down their
arms, and filing through a double line of troops were guarded throughout
the night by the British regiments.</p>

<p>History records few defeats more crushing than that of the French
and Bavarians at Blenheim. On the morning of the 13th of August
Tallard commanded about 60,000 troops, of whom not more than 20,000
ever found their way back to the armies of France or of Bavaria. The
carnage in the battle itself was very great, and in the flight large numbers
of the French were drowned in the Danube or murdered by the peasants,
who, with many old scores to settle, showed no mercy to small parties of
disbanded soldiers unable to protect themselves. Among the 11,000 prisoners
was Marshal de Tallard; and many guns and mortars, 171 standards, 129
pairs of colours, much bullion, hundreds of pack animals, and the whole
of the camp equipage fell into the hands of the conquerors. The victory,
however, cost the Allies about 12,500 officers and men, or roughly twenty-four
per cent of the force with which Marlborough began the battle. The
British casualties, according to Millner’s return,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> amounted to two thousand
three hundred and twenty-four of all ranks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>As a bounty was granted to those who took part in the battle the
names of the officers present have been preserved. The Colonel, Frederick
Hamilton, was in charge of a brigade, and drew £72. The regiment was
commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel R. Stearne, and the Major was Richard
Kane: the former received £51, and the latter £90. To each of the Captains&mdash;John
Moyle, Peter d’Offranville, Jos. Stroud, F. de la Penotière, N. Hussey,
Henry Browne, A. Rolleston, and W. Vaughan (or Vauclin), £30 was
paid. The Captain-Lieutenant, Thos. Laughlin, and the Lieutenants&mdash;George
Hall, James Lilly, Robert Parker, Wm. Leathes, Ben. Smith, Wm. Blakeney,
W. Weddall (or Weddell), Saml. Roberts, and John Harvey, drew £14 a
head; while £11 was the sum awarded to each of the Ensigns&mdash;John
Blakeney, Henry Walsh, John Cherry, W. Rolleston, Samuel Smith, R.
Tripp, Edward Walsh, and W. Moyle. The Quartermaster, Edm. Arwater,
was rated as a lieutenant, and the Adjutant, W. Blakeney, at £2 less; the
Surgeon, R. Weldon, received £12; his mate, R. Taylor, was considered
only worth £7, 10s.; and as the Chaplain, the Reverend Henry Reynolds,
drew £20, or rather more than the combined bounties of both doctors, it
would seem that in Marlborough’s army the care of the soul was better
paid than that of the body. There were a hundred and sixty-six casualties
in the XVIIIth, or about thirty per cent of those present. Among the officers
Captains H. Browne and A. Rolleston and Ensign W. Moyle were killed:
Captain W. Vaughan (or Vauclin) was mortally wounded: Major R. Kane,
Captains F. de la Penotière and N. Hussey, Lieutenants W. Weddall (or
Weddell), S. Roberts, J. Harvey, B. Smith, W. Blakeney, and Ensign R.
Tripp were wounded. In the other ranks five sergeants were killed and
nine wounded; fifty-two private soldiers were killed and eighty-seven
wounded.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>The morning after the battle Marlborough marched a few miles up the
river, and then encamped for four days to rest his weary troops, to set his
hospitals in order, and to dispose of his prisoners, of whom Millner speaks
as “a luggage that retarded our progress.” During this respite from
organised pursuit the French hurried back to the Rhine, whither they
were followed by the Allies, who laid siege to the fortress of Landau.
The XVIIIth was employed in the covering army, and in the middle of
October, a few weeks before the place was taken, all the British infantry
were embarked on river boats and floated down the Rhine to Nimeguen,
where after a ten days’ voyage they disembarked, so greatly reduced by
their losses in the campaign that for administrative purposes the fourteen
regiments were treated as seven provisional battalions. The troops marched
to their winter quarters to enjoy a well-earned rest and to discipline the
recruits who joined them from home. While the XVIIIth was at Ruremonde,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
where it spent several months, Brigadier Frederick Hamilton retired from
the service,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> and was succeeded as Colonel by Lieutenant-General R.
Ingoldsby, from the 23rd regiment of Foot.</p>

<p>The year 1705 afforded the XVIIIth no opportunities of adding to its
laurels, for as far as the regiment was concerned the campaign was one
of hard marching, great fatigue, and no fighting. Marlborough had planned
an invasion of France, and again entrusting to the Dutch the defence of
the Low Countries led his British contingent and a large number of their
Continental Allies towards the Moselle, whence he hoped to overrun Lorraine
and then carry the war into the enemy’s country. He expected to be
joined by a strong body of Germans under the Prince of Baden, a general
from whose jealousy and stupidity he had suffered acutely in the operations
of 1704; but after waiting many weeks for reinforcements which
never came, Marlborough determined to return to Flanders, where the enemy
had begun to show alarming signs of activity. Though Marshal de Villars,
one of the best soldiers of France, was watching his movements closely,
Marlborough broke up his camp and slipped away unmolested by the
French, who were nearly double his strength. With the elaborate politeness
of the time, he wrote to de Villars to apologise for retreating without
giving battle. “Do me the justice,” said he, “to believe that my defeat
is entirely owing to the failure of the Prince of Baden, but that my
esteem for you is still greater than my resentment for his conduct.”<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>When de Villeroi, who commanded the French in Flanders, heard that
Marlborough was coming back from the Moselle, he hastily retired to a
series of fortified lines stretching from Namur to Antwerp. These lines
the Duke determined to force, and by a series of brilliant manœuvres and
rapid marches succeeded in driving de Villeroi from them, with much loss
to the French and little to the Allies. But to inflict a decisive blow upon
the enemy a great battle was necessary. Marlborough twice placed the
French in situations where they would have to fight at a disadvantage,
and twice the Dutch generals, in their insane jealousy of the British
Commander-in-Chief, forbade the action by refusing to allow their soldiers
to engage. The XVIIIth appears to have spent much of the campaign in
levelling the captured lines, and when the work was finished, wintered at
Worcom, where in January, 1706, Lieutenant-Colonel Stearne received his
brevet of Colonel.</p>

<p>The opening of the campaign of 1706 found Marlborough more determined
than ever to defeat de Villeroi in a pitched battle; and in order to
draw the French general from his fortified lines on the river Dyle, he gave
him to understand through a secret agent that, as the Allies realised the
Marshal was afraid of them, they were about to besiege Namur, one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
fortresses of which Louis had repossessed himself by his vigorous action in
1701. The bait took. Stung by this insult, de Villeroi quitted the shelter of
his fortifications and marched to Tirlemont, apparently heading for Namur.
When Marlborough heard the welcome news, he pushed south-west from
Maestricht, with an army little inferior in numbers to de Villeroi’s 60,000
troops, and on the 22nd of May encamped at Coswaren, where he learned that
de Villeroi was moving upon Judoigne. The Duke decided to attack the
French there, and at 1 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span> on Whitsunday, May 23, 1706, he sent an advance
party under his Quartermaster-General, Cadogan, to select a camping-ground
near the village of Ramillies, which lies on the eastern edge of the highest
table-land in this part of Belgium.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Owing to a heavy mist, it was not
until eight o’clock that Cadogan discovered that there were hostile troops
upon the plateau. Two hours later the sun came out, and revealed to each
army the presence of the other, the French moving eastward across the
plateau, the Allies advancing from the opposite direction.</p>

<p>The main body of Marlborough’s troops had marched two hours after
the Quartermaster-General’s detachment, but the Duke had overtaken
Cadogan early in the day, and began to array his eight columns for battle.
De Villeroi, who had the advantage of a thorough knowledge of the ground,
took up a defensive position, marked on the right by the village of Taviers,
in the centre by Ramillies and Offuz, and on the left by a hamlet known as
Autre-Eglise or Anderkirche. A few hundred yards to the south of Taviers
the river Mehaigne ran from west to east through bogs and marshes; from
Taviers northwards to Ramillies, a distance of about a mile and a half, the
soil was firm and well suited for cavalry, but along the remainder of the
French line, about a mile and a quarter in length, the Little Geete meandered
in a shallow valley through morasses which opposite Autre-Eglise were
almost impassable. These villages were strongly held by infantry and
artillery, twenty battalions and twenty-four guns being allotted to the
defence of Ramillies alone. On the extreme left, between Autre-Eglise
and Offuz, were infantry supported by cavalry; from Offuz to Ramillies
the line was composed of infantry, while a hundred and twenty squadrons,
“interlaced” with a few battalions, were massed between that village and
Taviers.</p>

<p>Marlborough decided to attack the French right, between Ramillies and
the Mehaigne; and as his reconnaissance showed him that de Villeroi had
concentrated the greater part of his force upon this part of his line, he
determined, by demonstrating against the Marshal’s left, to induce him to
send reinforcements to that flank, and thus weaken the remainder of his
position. An imposing number of battalions accordingly marched towards
the Little Geete, descended into the valley opposite Autre-Eglise and Offuz,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
and made ostentatious preparations for throwing pontoon bridges over the
stream. On the extreme right of the allied infantry were several British
regiments, which the French staff easily identified by their uniforms and
their Colours; and when the Marshal heard that the soldiers whom he so
greatly feared were facing the left of his line, he drew largely from his right
and centre to strengthen the threatened spot. The Duke had successfully
“bluffed” de Villeroi; it now remained for him to transfer the greater part
of the infantry employed in this demonstration to the points where they
were really wanted. On the eastern side of the valley of the Little Geete
are hillocks, high enough to conceal the ground beyond them from observers
on the plateau; and over these hillocks the leading battalions retired gradually;
disappeared, and once out of the enemy’s sight, hastened to the centre of
the line. The British brought up the rear, but were ordered to halt at the
top, turn about and face the enemy: and there throughout the battle several
regiments remained, not firing a shot, but by their mere presence immobilising
the French left wing, and effectually preventing it from giving the help
urgently needed elsewhere.</p>

<p>By one o’clock the Duke’s preparations were finished, and after a preliminary
cannonade four Dutch battalions were launched against Taviers;
twelve battalions of the same nationality attacked Ramillies; while a great
body of Dutch cavalry stood waiting to advance when one or other of these
villages had fallen into the hands of the infantry. The garrison of Taviers
fought well, but owing to the blundering of a French staff officer the reinforcements
sent to its support did not arrive in time to prevent its capture,
and as soon as the Dutch cavalry saw that their left flank could not be
enfiladed from the village they charged the French horse, crashed through the
first line, and then were so roughly handled by the second that Marlborough
had to bring up many squadrons to their help. But these fresh squadrons
did not turn the scale, and before the Dutchmen could be induced to rally,
Marlborough&mdash;the Commander-in-Chief of the allied army, on whose life
depended not only the issue of the battle, but of the whole war&mdash;had to
plunge into the thick of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</i> and exert his personal influence with the
troopers, to all of whom he was well known by sight. But his face and
figure were familiar also to the enemy. Some French dragoons broke from
their ranks to surround him. He was unhorsed, and would have been killed
or captured had not his aide-de-camp mounted him on his own charger.
The Dutch then recovered themselves, and the timely arrival of twenty more
squadrons turned the tide against the French. While this cavalry fight was
in progress, the Danish Horse and the Dutch Guards forced their way
through the marshes on the bank of the Mehaigne, turned the French right
flank, and fell furiously upon their rear. Encouraged by this good news
the main body of Dutch cavalry returned to the charge, and with a final<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
effort shattered the enemy in front of them. Thus assailed on three sides,
the cavalry of de Villeroi’s right wing lost heart, left the infantry to shift
for themselves, and galloped madly off the field.</p>

<p>The battalions who defended the village of Ramillies, mindful of the fate
of their comrades at Blenheim, determined to retire before they were completely
hemmed in, but as they “could not get out but in great disorder our
Horse fell in with them and cut most of them to pieces.”<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> The Duke then
ordered the brigades of infantry which were massed round Ramillies to bring
up their left shoulders and advance against the still unbroken troops at Offuz;
but the French did not await their attack; and a couple of British regiments
from the extreme right worked through the swamps near Autre-Eglise, and
drove the enemy from that hamlet. Though a few of the best French cavalry
regiments fought hard to cover the retreat, the greater part of de Villeroi’s
army was routed and fled in panic, hotly pursued by Marlborough’s horsemen,
among whom the British squadrons were well to the front.</p>

<p>The French lost in killed, wounded, and prisoners about 11,000 men,
80 standards and colours, 50 guns, and much of the baggage of their army.
The Allies on their side lost between 4000 and 5000 men, chiefly among the
Dutch and the Danes, to whom the honour of this great victory is mainly due.</p>

<p>There is a curious conflict of evidence as to the part played by the
Royal Irish in this battle. According to Kane and Parker, the XVIIIth
was among the British regiments which, on the extreme right of the allied
line, stood all day on a hill without firing a shot. Stearne, on the other
hand, records in his journal that the regiment was “greatly mauled” at the
attack on the village of Ramillies; and Millner, at the end of his casualty
return (in which the losses of the different nationalities are not given),
mentions that “upwards of three hundred of our Horse and Dragoon horses
were killed or disabled at the head of the Royal Regiment of Foot of Ireland.”
If Stearne and Millner are correct, it would appear that the XVIIIth was
not only employed in the attack on Ramillies, but was also in close support
of the mounted troops during some part of the pursuit.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>Marlborough’s enemies had blamed him for slackness in not profiting by
his victory at Blenheim; but not even his most virulent political opponents
could impute want of vigour to him after Ramillies. Although his infantry
had paraded before 3 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span>, had marched many miles and had won a great
victory, he gave them no rest till 1 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span> on the 24th, when they were allowed
to halt for two hours; then they trudged on “with all the expedition they
could without observing any other order than this, that every regiment
kept their men as close together as they possibly could, and none of them
halted above an hour at a time.”<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Marlborough drove the French back
into their own country, and within a fortnight of the battle all the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
trading towns had opened their gates to the Allies, while very few fortresses
in Flanders remained in the hands of Louis XIV.’s troops. Over the walls
of Ostend, Dendermonde, and Menin the French flag still flew, but these
towns were attacked and taken in the course of a few weeks.</p>

<p>At the capture of Menin, one of Vauban’s masterpieces of fortification, the
XVIIIth won much glory. In July the Duke detached 20,000 troops to besiege
it; and though the garrison of 5000 men fought admirably and disputed every
inch of ground, by the end of the month most of the guns were dismounted,
and the approaches of the British brigade had reached the foot of the glacis.
The next step was to capture the covered way and counterscarp; and about
eight o’clock on the evening of the 7th of August, nine complete battalions,
of which the XVIIIth was one, delivered the assault. As Stearne remarks,
“this proved warm service,” for, as the Allies were swarming up the glacis,
two mines were sprung upon them; and when the inevitable confusion was
over and the attack was resumed, the French fired venomously at the crest of
the glacis, where the British were covering the advance of the working
parties bringing wool-packs and fascines with which to throw up entrenchments.
The Royal Irish and Lauder’s, an unnumbered corps since disbanded,
appear to have been at the head of the column, and were so much annoyed
by this musketry that without orders they began to reply to it. The flashes
of their firelocks gave the French a target, and before the officers could stop
the firing the losses in these two regiments had been great. Stearne, who
was in command of the XVIIIth, says that the action cost him six officers
and more than eighty of the other ranks killed and wounded. Parker, the
adjutant of the regiment, mentions that two captains and five subalterns
were killed and eight other officers wounded, but is silent about the casualties
among the sergeants and private soldiers. Millner agrees with the adjutant
about the officers and with the colonel about the men.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Notwithstanding
their losses, the Allies held the crest of the glacis until eight o’clock next
morning, when the working parties had finished the entrenchments; then
fresh batteries began to play upon the walls, and in a short time the resistance
was fairly beaten down and the garrison surrendered on honourable
terms. The siege lasted thirty-one days, and cost the French eleven hundred
officers and men, while the Allies’ strength was diminished by two thousand
six hundred combatants.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1707, the Allies assembled at Bethlehem, where the British
contingent was joined by the Royal Irish from their winter quarters at Ghent.
Owing to the underhand conduct of the Emperor of Austria, who for his private
ends made a secret treaty with Louis XIV. for the neutralisation of Italy,
the French were able to withdraw their troops from that country and largely
reinforce the Marshal de Vendôme, who had succeeded de Villeroi in command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
of their “army of Flanders.” But de Vendôme had no wish to fight
Marlborough, and a long spell of very bad weather helped him to evade all
the Duke’s efforts to bring him to battle. Stearne in his journal mentions
that “there fell such rain that our men were not able to draw their legs after
them, neither could they keep their arms or ammunition dry.” On one
occasion the Allies were struggling over nine miles of country, along which
the French had just retreated, “but what with the enemy marching before us,
and our Horse which followed them, and the rain continuing the roads were
so deep and miry that the most part of our infantry were not able to reach
the camp that night, and it was three or four days before the rear came up,
and several of them perished by the way.”<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>In the hope of raising a rebellion in North Britain, Louis XIV. attempted
early in 1708 to land the Pretender in Scotland, with a handful of French
soldiers to train the partisans who were expected to flock to the standard
of the Stuart Prince. The expedition sailed long before the campaign opened
on the Continent; to meet it the XVIIIth and nine other regiments were
hurriedly shipped off to Shields, where the transports anchored while their
escort of men-of-war joined in the chase of the enemy’s vessels, which were
driven back to France. As soon as the danger was over the troops were
sent off to Ostend, where they arrived in full time to rejoin Marlborough’s
army.</p>

<p>Early in the year it became evident that Louis intended to make a great
effort to regain the ground he had lost in Flanders, for he assembled a hundred
thousand men behind his frontier fortresses, and placed them under the
command of his grandson the Duke of Burgundy, with de Vendôme as his
military tutor and adviser. As Marlborough had but eighty thousand troops
at his immediate disposal, he arranged that Eugene, the Prince of Savoy, who
was in charge of the allied forces on the Rhine, should support him whenever
he wanted help. This help was soon required, for the French took the
initiative, and at the end of May advanced to the forest of Soignies. While
Marlborough concentrated at Hal, de Vendôme rapidly despatched detachments
to Bruges and Ghent, where the civil authorities were in his pay; and when
Louis’ soldiers appeared outside the walls, the gates stood open before them.
Having thus secured two very important points in the system of waterways
connected with the Lys and the Scheldt, de Vendôme next threatened Brussels;
and by forcing Marlborough to move to Asche for its protection, gained time
to prepare for the attack on Oudenarde, the capture of which would make him
master of the greater part of the Scheldt. He proposed to cover the siege
operations from Lessines, a place about thirteen miles south-east of Oudenarde,
and hoped to establish his main body there before Marlborough had grasped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
his plan; but the Duke’s secret service agents did not fail him, and when he
learned that de Vendôme was to move southwards from his camp at Alost on
July 9, he determined to outstrip him by starting from Asche long before
dawn on the same day. As the reinforcements from the Rhine had not yet
arrived, in point of actual numbers the Allies were considerably weaker than
the French; but Eugene, leaving his own troops many marches behind him,
had recently joined the English general&mdash;and the mere presence of Eugene
was in itself worth many thousand men. In a straight line the Allies and the
French had about the same distance, twenty miles, to march, but by the roads
followed by the Allies the mileage was nearly fifty per cent greater. Almost
without a pause, Marlborough’s troops tramped steadily from 2 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span> till noon,
when, with fifteen miles to their credit, they halted till the evening, though
Cadogan’s detachment of eight squadrons and as many battalions was allowed
only four hours’ rest before starting for Lessines, thirteen miles farther on.
Throughout the night the main body pressed forward and reached their
destination to find that their exertions had not been thrown away&mdash;they had
outmarched the French: no enemy was in sight, and Cadogan, who had
struggled into Lessines at midnight, had already thrown several pontoon
bridges across the river Dender. Not until the Allies had reached their
camping ground did the heads of the French columns begin to show on the
horizon; and when de Vendôme and the Duke of Burgundy realised that
Marlborough lay between them and France, they abandoned all hope of
besieging Oudenarde, and fell back on the Scheldt to secure the safety
of Bruges.</p>

<p>Marlborough decided to follow them, and Cadogan with eleven thousand
troops of all arms, including Sabine’s brigade of the 8th, XVIIIth, 23rd, and
37th regiments, quietly left the camp in the small hours of July 11. The
duty of this advance-guard was to make all preparations for the crossing
from the right bank of the Scheldt to the left by the main body, which was
due to arrive at Oudenarde a few hours after Cadogan. Between 10 and
11 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span> its cavalry scouts had crossed the river a few hundred yards below
the town, and were riding up to the thickly enclosed table-land between the
principal stream and its northern affluent, the Norken,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> when they saw to
their front a number of French troopers scouring the country for forage.
Vendôme had marched down the right bank to Gavre, a few miles below
Oudenarde, and was then in process of crossing the Scheldt. These foraging
parties were part of the French advance-guard, for de Vendôme, who apparently
had taken no steps to watch the movements of the Allies, was so unconscious
of danger that many of his men had been allowed to disperse. The French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Horse, however, quickly recovered from their surprise at finding Marlborough
on their heels, and drove back our scouts, discovering in the course of the
pursuit that a body of his cavalry was on the plateau near the village of
Eyne, and that some of the bridges over the river near Oudenarde were in
his hands.</p>

<p>As soon as de Vendôme realised the situation he decided to form along the
slopes overlooking the Scheldt; the line was to stretch from Heurne on his
left to Mooregem on his right, and after ordering a detachment of cavalry and
seven battalions to occupy Heurne, he rode back to report his dispositions to
the Duke of Burgundy, whom he found at breakfast. French writers say that
the Prince greatly disliked any interruption at his meals, and the news that
the Allies were on the same bank of the river as himself was very unwelcome.
There was already great friction between the Prince and his military “bearleader”;
and to vent his spleen upon the Marshal the Duke of Burgundy
peremptorily rejected the veteran’s plan, and insisted on preparing to give
battle, not close to the bank of the Scheldt, where there was a good chance of
crushing Marlborough’s columns as they came piece-meal into action, but two
miles farther back, on the far side of the Norken, with his left at Asper and
his right at Wannegem. From that moment things began to go wrong with the
French. In the confusion caused by the rejection of the Marshal’s scheme no
one thought of recalling the cavalry and infantry ordered to Heurne: and
these luckless troops marched steadily towards a village which they believed
to be Heurne, though it proved to be the hamlet of Eyne, well within the
reach of Cadogan’s infantry.</p>

<p>While the French generals were laboriously forming their army behind
the Norken, Cadogan was throwing pontoon bridges over the Scheldt, and
anxiously scanning the horizon for the clouds of dust which would herald the
march of the main body of the Allies. But the day was stifling, the roads
narrow and bad; it was not until two o’clock in the afternoon that the heads
of the columns began to reach the river, and thus set Cadogan free to secure
for his chief a good foothold on the left bank. The first thing to be done was
to drive the French out of Eyne; and a body of Hanoverian cavalry and three
brigades of infantry from the advance-guard were ordered to attack the
village. Sabine’s brigade of British was in front, and as it was led by the
Royal Irish, the XVIIIth was the first regiment under fire at the battle of
Oudenarde. Though the garrison of Eyne were conscious that they had been
stranded in an impossible position, so far in advance of their main line that
they could not hope to be reinforced, they fought well at first; but when they
realised that they were heavily outnumbered they lost heart: three battalions
surrendered: the others were hustled out of the village at the point of the
bayonet, and then fell into the hands of the Hanoverians, who after cutting
them to pieces charged the detachment of French cavalry posted near Eyne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and chased it into the marshes of the Norken.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Cadogan followed up his
success by pushing two Prussian regiments towards Groenewald, thus to some
extent protecting the right flank of the main body as it crossed the Scheldt.</p>

<p>The French troops who had been powerless to help their comrades at Eyne
became clamorous to avenge them, and the Duke of Burgundy, seeing how
slowly the Allies defiled over the bridges, determined to take the offensive,
and ordered his right and centre to advance. About five o’clock a formidable
mass of infantry threatened Groenewald, where the Prussians would have fared
badly had they not been reinforced at once by twelve battalions of the advance-guard,
who, as they came into action, prolonged the line to the left&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>, southwards,
towards the hamlet of Schaerken. But as the French continued to
gain ground on this part of the field twenty battalions from the main body
were flung into the fray, and by continuing to extend to the left as they
joined the fighting line, repulsed a dangerous attempt by the enemy to turn
the left of the Allies at this point.</p>

<p>In the enclosures round Groenewald every hedge and ditch became a
miniature fortress, taken and retaken as the tide of battle ebbed and flowed;
and near the village of Schaerken the Allies could hardly keep the enemy in
check until the Duke reinforced this part of the line. Then slowly, and with
great difficulty, the Dutch and Hanoverians forced the French back a few
hundred yards to Diepenbeck; but there they met with so stubborn a resistance
that they could gain no further ground. Some writers say that the
French infantry had fallen back to a belt of abattis prepared earlier in the
day; be that as it may, the fact remains that at this point de Vendôme’s
infantry fought magnificently, and brought Marlborough’s foot soldiers to a
standstill. Fortunately the Duke had in hand a reserve of some twenty
battalions and many squadrons, all of whom had so recently crossed the river
that they had not yet come into action; and with these troops he turned the
right of the enemy’s line, drove in the outer flank of their infantry, and after
dispersing a body of de Vendôme’s cavalry fell upon the right rear of the
French army. About this time, but far too late to influence the issue of the
battle, the Duke of Burgundy ordered his left to move forward; but his foot
soldiers did nothing, and his horsemen were paralysed by the sight of the British
regiments of cavalry, drawn up on the far side of the swamp across which
they were called upon to advance. Thus the combat resolved itself into a
struggle round the villages of Groenewald and Diepenbeck, and as night fell
the flashes of the muskets showed that the French line, ever growing thinner
and narrower, was hour by hour more closely hemmed in on front and flank
and rear by Marlborough’s infantry. Soon it became too dark to distinguish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
friend from foe, and after parties from the right and left wings of the Allies
had met in rear of the French position and fired into each other, Marlborough
ordered his weary troops to break off the battle, to halt where they stood,
and be ready to resume the combat at dawn next day. But at daybreak
there was no enemy to fight. When the French right flank was turned the
Duke of Burgundy again quarrelled fiercely with de Vendôme. The General
tried to keep the army together; the Prince insisted on an immediate retreat;
the troops lost their discipline, and following the example of Louis XIV.’s
grandson, a mass of runaways&mdash;generals and private soldiers, horse, foot and
artillery&mdash;streamed off the field. Not all the French broke, however: by dint
of de Vendôme’s personal exertions he rallied enough officers and men to form
the rear-guard, with which he covered the “stampede” to Ghent.</p>

<p>The French lost about 6000 killed and wounded, and 9000 prisoners;<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> and
(according to Millner) we took from them 10 guns, 56 pairs of colours, 52
standards, and 4500 horses. The casualties among the Allies were about 3000
killed or wounded, more than half of which were among the Dutch. The British
suffered very little, 53 officers and men being killed and 177 wounded. The
Royal Irish, though the first regiment to come in action, were extremely
lucky in losing only a lieutenant and 8 private soldiers killed and 12
wounded.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>While Marlborough’s troops were enjoying forty-eight hours’ well-earned
rest, an audacious project was forming itself in their great leader’s brain. He
knew that an expedition was being prepared in England for a descent on the
coast of Normandy, and that to meet it many battalions would be drawn off
from the centre of France. The Duke of Burgundy’s army was reeling under
the stroke of Oudenarde, and would take weeks to recover itself. Why should
not the Allies profit by this favourable combination of circumstances, and
leaving a detachment to watch the garrison of Lille, neglect that great
frontier fortress and carry the war into the very heart of France? But the
scheme was too daring, even for Eugene, who insisted that Lille must be captured
as a preliminary to a serious invasion. So the Duke made up his mind
to reduce Lille, and marching across the French frontier formed a camp near
Commines, levying large contributions from the neighbouring towns, while he
began his preparations for the siege. A single detail will be enough to show
how enormous these preparations were&mdash;the staff had to collect 16,000 horses
to drag the big guns and ammunition over the seventy-five miles of villanous
road between Lille and Brussels, where the heavy ordnance was stored.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>The arrival of the Duke of Berwick<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> with large reinforcements from the
Rhine raised the Duke of Burgundy’s strength to at least 100,000 combatants.
To meet them Marlborough had only 84,000 troops; but when after many
weeks’ delay his huge convoy started from Brussels, he manœuvred so brilliantly
that the enemy was never able to come within striking distance of its
cumbrous length. It was not until the 22nd of August that the Allies broke
ground before Lille, which every Frenchman regarded as impregnable, for on
its fortification Vauban had lavished all his skill, 150 guns and mortars
frowned from its works, and Marshal de Boufflers commanded its garrison of
15,000 picked men. The siege was to be carried on by Eugene, while from
Helchin on the Scheldt Marlborough covered the operations with the field
army. Among Eugene’s troops the British were not strongly represented:
“only five regiments were detailed for regular work in the trenches”<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>&mdash;the
16th, 21st, 23rd, 24th, and as hard knocks were to be expected, it is scarcely
necessary to add, the XVIIIth also. The Duke had hardly finished his lines
of circumvallation, or, in modern language, the works protecting his own
front and Eugene’s rear, when he learned that the Duke of Burgundy was
advancing to the relief of Lille. For a week the armies lay opposite each
other. Marlborough and Eugene were anxious to attack the French, whose
position was so bad that Berwick saw nothing but defeat in store for them if
they gave battle; but once again the Dutch deputies threw away splendid
chances by refusing to allow their troops to fight. The French generals,
though under positive orders from Louis to wipe out their disgrace at Oudenarde
by winning a great battle near Lille, declined the combat, and withdrew
to devote themselves to the safer task of harassing the Allies’ line of communication.
By taking up and holding strongly positions running along the
Scheldt and the Scarpe from Ghent to Douai, they hoped to intercept all
convoys from Brussels, at that time the Duke’s chief source of supply, but
they forgot that in Ostend, which Marlborough had recaptured two years
before, he possessed on the open sea a port within easy distance of England.
The troops which had just returned from the expedition to Normandy&mdash;an
expedition as futile as most of our similar enterprises seemed fated to be&mdash;were
landed at Ostend, where they were employed most usefully in forming a
new base.</p>

<p>The chief interest in this part of the campaign is centred in Marlborough’s
success in keeping the besiegers supplied with food and ammunition, for the
French could range at will over the greater part of the country between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Ostend and Lille, and they had possession of the sluices that could inundate
the districts through which the convoys had to pass. After the brilliant little
fight at Wynendal, where a valuable convoy fought its way through a very
superior force, de Vendôme laid the neighbourhood of Ostend under water;
but the Duke organised a service of punts in which, despite the attentions of
French gunboats, stores were transported over the deepest part of the flood,
and then transferred to vehicles fitted with very high wheels to keep their
loads above the level of the water.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>The strain upon the Commander-in-Chief at this time must have been
indescribable, for in addition to the constant anxiety about his commissariat,
things did not always go well at Lille, where de Boufflers defended himself
in a masterly manner: Eugene was so badly wounded that for some weeks he
could not direct the operations: the engineers made mistakes, and the supply
of ammunition was always scanty. When to these troubles was added the
arrival from the Rhine of a large body of the enemy under the Elector of
Bavaria, who laid vigorous siege to Brussels, the nerves of most men would
have suffered; but with unbroken serenity Marlborough prepared to rescue
Brussels from the danger threatening it. After misleading the French
by false reports about his movements, he burst through their line of defences
on the Scheldt, and so alarmed the Elector that he hurriedly decamped, leaving
behind him his sick, his wounded, and his guns.</p>

<p>The details of the doings of the XVIIIth in the siege of Lille are very
scanty; but it is known that in a great, though not very successful assault
on September 7, when Eugene lost about 3000 men, his five British regiments
between them had 350 casualties, or from a fifth to a sixth of their whole
strength.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> In a desperate attack on the counterscarp a fortnight later,
Eugene was followed by a number of British troops, among whom were some
regiments lent for the occasion by the covering army. In his memoirs he
relates that after two assaults had been repulsed with great slaughter, he
spoke a few words in English to the brave fellows who rallied round him, and
then led them back to the fire, where a musket-ball knocked him senseless.
The men thought he was dead; but an intelligent soldier remembered that he
was a great friend of the Duke’s, and after looking for some conveyance on
which to transport him to his quarters, carried him back on a dung cart! On
the 9th of December de Boufflers surrendered on excellent terms, granted him
as a proof of Marlborough’s admiration for his splendid defence, which had cost
France 8000 men, and the Allies about 14,000 in killed and wounded alone.
The returns of the British losses are incomplete: Millner states that from the
beginning of the siege to October 22, when the French abandoned the town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and retreated in the citadel, the five British regiments in Eugene’s force lost
1600 officers and men; the casualties for the remainder of the siege he was
unable to obtain. Stearne briefly dismisses the services of the XVIIIth at
Lille in the following words: “Our regiment suffered very much, having two
captains and three subalterns killed: our major, with several other officers
wounded, and upwards of 200 men killed and wounded.”<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>It would be deeply interesting to know how many of the Royal Irish who
watched the garrison of Lille march out with all the honours of war had seen
the ceremonial at Namur thirteen years before. Unfortunately it occurred to
none of the literary officers of the XVIIIth to record the numbers. The
mental attitude of these old warriors is very curious: they seem to have
grown tired of writing about battles and sieges, and as the war went on cut
their descriptions shorter and shorter, though they were ready to dilate on
any departure from the usual routine of warfare. Thus, for example, they
all give accounts of a daring attempt to throw reinforcements of powder into
Lille. Two thousand cavalrymen started from Douai, carrying large bags of
powder behind them, and wearing in their hats “boughs of trees,” in imitation
of the Germans who always decorated themselves in this way when on an
expedition&mdash;or as the British soldier would now express it, “when on the job.”
In the dusk they rode up to the outer barrier of the line of circumvallation,
gave over the pass-word, and stating they were a detachment of German
Horse with prisoners, were allowed to enter. Then they rode on undetected,
until one of the party, to use modern slang, “gave the show away,” by
remarking in French to a comrade that they had got through the barrier
very easily. A watchful sentry overheard him, drew his own conclusions, and
by promptly firing at the speaker gave the alarm. The troops, says Millner,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“instantly turned out of their Tents in only their Shirts and Cartridge
Boxes with their Ammunition, and seiz’d their Arms from their Belts,
and in a Trice form’d themselves into as good Order as could be expected,
and with undaunted Courage, though in the Dark, fired amongst the
thickest of the Enemy putting them in great Disorder and Confusion, so
that in the Hurly-Burly thereof, several of the Bags of Powder fell off on
a Causeway, and was broke; the which by the prancing of the Horses’
Feet, took Fire, and thereby blowed up and tore to pieces upwards of one
Hundred Men of them, and likewise destroyed a good many of their
Horses; but in the interim thereof, a few of them slipt into the City with
some Ammunition also; but the major Part was obliged to retire, and that
in very great Haste, Disorder and Confusion back again to Tournai....
The Besieged made a great Huzzaing that Night because they had got
those few in with some Relief of Powder.”</p></div>

<p>While de Boufflers was discussing with Marlborough the terms of capitulation,
the other French Generals, thinking that the Duke was as much worn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
out by the campaign as they were themselves, sent their men into winter
quarters and went off to Paris. But they reckoned without their host.
Marlborough sprang at Ghent, and invested it, repulsed a great sortie on
Christmas Day, and accepted the surrender of the garrison on January 2,
1709. The French troops in Bruges did not wait to be attacked, but
abandoned the town and citadel: and then, but not till then, the Allies were
allowed to disperse to their winter quarters.</p>

<p>During the greater part of the year 1708 the regiment was deprived of the
services of the adjutant, Captain Robert Parker, who was specially selected to
act as instructor in discipline and drill to the regiments at that time quartered
in Ireland. To any officer the compliment would have been great; but in
Parker’s case it was especially flattering, because he was a self-made man who
had risen from the ranks. His story is an interesting one. His father was a
farmer near Kilkenny, where the boy was sent to a school which boasted of a
company of cadets (as we should now call them), who were “armed with
wooden guns and took great delight in marching and exercising.” These
cadets must have been a remarkable set of lads, as more than thirty of them
obtained commissions, and some indeed became General officers. Parker soon
discovered that soldiering was the trade for him, and running away from
home, enlisted in an independent company commanded by Captain Frederick
Hamilton, the future Colonel of the XVIIIth Regiment. During the Tyrconnel
troubles both Hamilton and Parker were disbanded, but April, 1689, found
them in Meath’s regiment, the one a major, the other a full private. Parker
joined with a strong determination to get on in his profession. “I determined
to be very circumspect in my behaviour, by which I gained the esteem of my
Major and most of the officers of the regiment. I applied myself diligently
to the use of arms, and soon became expert in it.” Whether he had risen to
be a sergeant in the Irish wars is not known: all he tells us about himself at
that time is that at Athlone in throwing up an entrenchment he “received a
favourable shot on the crown of the head; the ball only grazed on a good
thick skull and went off”; and that at the end of the siege he was much
injured by a stone dropped on him by the defenders of the castle. He must
have been a non-commissioned officer in 1695; desperately wounded at Namur,
he found when he returned to duty after seven months in hospital, that he
had been gazetted to a commission, with seven ensigns junior to him. Eleven
years later he was Captain-Lieutenant and Adjutant, and after receiving at
Menin “a contusion on the side of the head which was likely to be fatal,” was
promoted to be captain of the grenadier company. Parker was so successful
in disciplining the infantry in Ireland that, when after two years he returned
to duty with the regiment in Flanders, Government made him a present of
two hundred pounds.</p>

<p>Though Louis had suffered heavily in 1708, the enormous resources of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
kingdom enabled him to send large numbers of fresh troops to the Marshal de
Villars, whom early in 1709 he placed in command of the army of Flanders.
De Villars’ first care had been to secure the safety of Arras, the key to the
north-east of France, by throwing up to the east of the town a great line of
works which stretched from the Lys to Douai; and from behind these works,
known as the lines of La Bassée, he watched the Allies, who owing to the
lateness of the season did not take the field till June. Marlborough’s first
move was to make open, even ostentatious preparations to force the lines; de
Villars concentrated to resist them, calling up as reinforcements a large
portion of the garrison of Tournai, a fortress some sixteen miles east of Lille.
As Tournai was Marlborough’s immediate objective, he marched swiftly upon
it, and invested it before de Villars discovered how completely he had been
outwitted. At the beginning of the siege the XVIIIth took part in an
expedition to reduce various small forts in the neighbourhood, and after
marching night and day returned “greatly fatigued,”<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> but in time to help to
storm the breaches of the ravelin, and to repulse a determined sortie by the
garrison, who strove to make up for the weakness of their numbers by the
vigour of their defence. Up to the time that the town surrendered and the
troops retired into the citadel, the siege had run on normal lines; but when
the attack on the citadel began things became very different, for this stronghold
was celebrated throughout Europe for its subterranean defences, and
the ground outside its walls was honeycombed with casemates, mines, and
secret passages. To reach these hidden works the besiegers had to sink deep
shafts, and then to drive tunnels fathoms deep under the earth, at any moment
liable to be blown sky-high by the explosion of a mine. The desperate work
done by the XVIIIth in this phase of the siege is well described by Stearne.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The enemy and we met several times underground and fought it out
with bayonet and pistol, and in twelve days the French sprang sixteen
mines, which blew up a great many of our men; and one mine did so
much execution that it blew up part of the town wall, two branches of
our trenches with a parallel between them, and ruined two of our mines,
with a Captain and Lieutenant of our regiment and another officer and
forty men, all of which happened on our attack.... Our miners discovered
the branches of another mine, and as they were busy in finding
out the mine itself, they heard the enemy at work in one of their
galleries, whereupon a Lieutenant and twenty Grenadiers were ordered
to dislodge them, but the Lieutenant being killed at the first onset the
Grenadiers retired immediately; after that another officer with a fresh
detachment was ordered for that service, but the enemy throwing a great
many grenades and making a great smoke with combustible stuff, forced
them to retire being suffocated. The next day, the miners being supported
by a Lieutenant and sixteen Grenadiers, were at work, to pierce
through a gallery they had discovered, but upon their breaking into it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the enemy threw in upon them a great quantity of straw, hemp, powder
and other combustible matter, and being set on fire the Lieutenant and
ten of the Grenadiers were stifled. After this manner was this terrible
siege carried on, till by degrees we wrought ourselves almost into the
ditch. The enemy sprang a mine which was their last effort, with which
we had near four hundred men killed, but notwithstanding we lodged
ourselves that night on our attack near their palisades, where we raised a
prodigious quantity of cannon.”</p></div>

<p>The citadel capitulated on the 3rd of September, after more than 3000
French officers and men had fallen. The besiegers’ casualties are given in
Millner’s return as 1233 killed, 4055 wounded, or a grand total of 5288. Millner
is not as clear as usual about the loss of the British, but it seems probable
that 178 were killed and 521 wounded, or 699 of all ranks. To what extent
the Royal Irish suffered it is impossible to say, but it is probable that in such
continuous fighting more officers and men were placed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de combat</i> than
are mentioned in Stearne’s narrative.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>As soon as Marlborough saw that the defence of Tournai was weakening,
he marched a large force towards the lines of La Bassée; again demonstrated
against de Villars, whom he puzzled completely, and then, after a march of
forty-nine miles in fifty-six hours, in pouring rain over roads knee-deep in
mud, swooped upon Mons, a town important to the French, though at that
time only weakly held. When de Villars slowly realised that the Duke had
no intention of wasting his strength in storming highly fortified lines, he
advanced with 95,000 men, and entrenched himself at the Trouée d’Aulnoit,
one of the few gaps in a belt of woodland which lay a few miles to the south
of Mons. He outnumbered the Allies so greatly that they decided not to
attack him until the troops left to level the siege-works at Tournai had
rejoined headquarters, and thus made Marlborough’s numerical strength equal
to that of his opponent. These troops, among which were the XVIIIth and
several other British regiments, were ordered up at once, but while they were
on the march de Villars, by working night and day, rendered his position very
formidable. His right rested on the forest of Laignières, half a mile from
the village of Malplaquet,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> which has given its name to the battle of the 11th
of September, 1709: his centre ran across the southern end of the gap, which
was open, fairly level, and about 2000 yards in width: his left was thrown
forward into the continuous series of woods known respectively as those of
Taignières, Blangies, and Sart. Across his centre he built long lines of
trenches, gun emplacements, chains of abattis, and many strong redans; the
woods on his flanks were similarly protected, and when the attackers had
forced their way through the abattis which fringed the edges they came under
the fire of field-works hidden in the depths of the forest. The weak point of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the position was that cavalry could only act offensively on the plain&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>, the
gap between the woods; and as this open ground was covered with defences
Villars had to draw up his Horse in rear of the rest of his troops, where they
would be unable to come into action unless the Allies broke through some
part of the front line.</p>

<p>For the attack of this position, which from the nature of its fortifications
had virtually become a fortress, the Duke issued the following orders:
The Prince of Orange with thirty-one battalions, most of which were Dutch,
was to make a demonstration against the right of the French line; sixty-eight
battalions were to assail the northern and eastern faces of the woods of
Taignières and Sart; while General Withers, with five British and fourteen
foreign battalions, was to strike and turn the extreme left of the enemy’s
line at the village of La Folie. As the pressure on the French left became
intense, the Duke expected (as did actually happen) that de Villars would
draw largely from his centre to reinforce the point of danger; then fifteen
British battalions and other infantry, till then held back in the centre, were to
be launched at the works in the gap, capture them, and thus win a passage
for the allied cavalry, which was then to crash through Villars’ centre and
cut his army in twain. The heavier guns were massed into two great batteries&mdash;one
playing on the enemy’s right, the other on his left.</p>

<p>Though the advanced parties of the hostile armies watched each other
throughout the night at little more than a musket’s shot distance, nothing
happened to disturb the few hours’ rest which the Duke allowed his men.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
Long before daylight the troops were under arms, and when morning service
had been read at the head of every regiment, the Duke rode through his
army, correcting faulty dispositions and sending to their places in the line of
battle the horse and dragoons who during the night had arrived from
Tournai. They had left behind them on the road the infantry, who came
on as best they could, the last to reach the battlefield being the Royal Irish,
whose march was retarded by the slow-moving guns they had to escort.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
After an hour’s artillery duel Marlborough began to carry his plan into
effect, and launched his infantry columns against Villars’ flanks. At first
things went well. His right made some progress, though in the woods of
Taignières and Sart the French fought superbly, disputing every inch of
ground, and by vigorous counter-attacks often sending their assailants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
reeling back upon their supports; and on his left the Prince of Orange
kept the enemy occupied in the forest of Laignières by his feigned attack.
Suddenly, in direct defiance of his orders from the Duke, this General took
upon himself to attack in real earnest; but the French fell upon his column
with such resistless energy that the Dutch, stubborn fighters as they were,
were driven back with hideous slaughter. Marlborough received this startling
news with composure; he directed the Prince of Orange to content
himself with holding the French without again attacking them; and confident
of ultimate success, in no way altered his original dispositions.</p>

<p>While the Prince of Orange was being buffeted on the left, Eugene, who
commanded on the right flank, was forcing the French backwards through the
woods. The process, though slow and very costly, was sure; and when de
Villars, who had taken charge of the French left, heard that the red-coats
of Withers’ column were appearing on his flank at La Folie, he did exactly
what Marlborough expected him to do, and weakened his centre to reinforce
his left. Three brigades, one of them composed of the Irishmen who had
done so well at Blenheim, hurried up to de Villars’ help, plunged into the
wood, and drove the Allies back on their supports. In this charge the Irish
Brigade with reckless valour pursued so far that they lost their formation, and
the whole or part of one of its battalions found itself alone in a glade,
where it was attacked by the Royal Irish. The XVIIIth had come so late
into action that it had been sent off to the extreme right of the whole
army, where, in modern phraseology, it seems to have acted “on its own,”
and according to Parker marched on till it came</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“to an open in the wood. It was a small plain, on the opposite side
of which we perceived a battalion of the enemy drawn up. Upon this
Colonel Kane who was then at the head of the regiment, having drawn
us up and formed our Platoons, advanced gently towards them, and the
six Platoons of our first fire made ready. When we had advanced within
a hundred yards of them, they gave us a fire of one of their ranks, whereupon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
we halted, and returned them the fire of our six Platoons at once;
and immediately made ready the six Platoons of our second fire, and
advanced upon them again. They then gave us the fire of another rank,
and we returned them a second fire, which made them shrink; however
they gave us the fire of a third rank after a scattering manner, and then
retired into the wood in great disorder, on which we sent our third fire
after them, and saw them no more. We advanced cautiously up to the
ground which they had quitted and found several of them, killed and
wounded; among the latter was one Lieutenant O’Sullivan, who told us
the battalion we had engaged was the Royal Regiment of Ireland in the
French service.”</p></div>

<p>In this skirmish the XVIIIth, or Royal regiment of Foot of Ireland, had
but few casualties; while the Iro-Gallic regiment, as “their opposite number”
in Louis’ army was termed, is said to have lost several officers and about
forty men.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>While the Irishmen were settling their quarrel, the climax of the battle
was approaching. Eugene had rallied his infantry in the wood of Taignières,
and was struggling to hold his own against the fresh troops which de Villars in
person led against him. Both generals were wounded&mdash;Eugene was struck on
the head by a musket-ball, but refused to leave the fighting line to have his
injury attended to by a surgeon; de Villars, hard hit in the leg, made a
gallant effort to direct the battle from a chair, but swooning from pain was
carried away insensible to the nearest village. Though deprived of their
leader, the French fought obstinately, and on the right of the allied line
the combat raged without any decisive result, neither side knowing that when
the three brigades were moved from the centre to the left of de Villars’ line,
Marlborough had ordered the Dutch forward on his left, and had hurled himself
against the heart of the French position. Orkney’s fifteen battalions of
British infantry, who for many hours had been waiting for their chance, were
let loose against the redans across their front, and carrying them after a
sharp fight, promptly lined with marksmen the reverse parapets&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>, those
looking backwards into the enemy’s second line. On the left, the Dutch
infantry atoned for their mistake in the morning by capturing not only
the wood of Laignières, but the abattis and trenches connecting it with
the works now in the hands of the red-coated battalions, and the Dutch
cavalry poured through the openings won by their infantry comrades. But
in the scramble over shelter trenches and abattis their ranks became disordered,
and before they had time to re-form they were attacked by the
Gendarmerie, and forced to take shelter under the muskets of Orkney’s
battalions, whose steady shooting beat off the French and gained time for
Marlborough to come up with the British and Prussian horse. These were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
driving the Gendarmerie backwards, when a splendid counter-attack of the
French Household troops crashed through their first line, penetrated the
second, and threw the third into confusion. At that moment Eugene,
dashing up bloodstained from his wound, threw his last squadrons against
the enemy’s flank; Louis’ Bodyguard wavered and gave way, and de
Boufflers, on whom the command had devolved after de Villars was
wounded, seeing that his centre was pierced, his right dislodged, and his
left beaten though not routed, ordered a retreat.</p>

<p>His retirement was quite unmolested by the Allies, who were too much
exhausted to pursue an enemy who after such a desperate struggle was
still able to retire in good order. Marlborough had begun the engagement
with about 95,000 troops, but by three o’clock in the afternoon twenty
thousand of his men were killed or wounded. Millner’s analysis of the
casualties shows that the Germans lost 5321 officers and men; the Prussians,
1694; the Hanoverians, 2219; the Dutch (thanks to the Prince of Orange’s
untimely movement), 8680; and the British, 1783. In the British contingent
32 officers were killed and 111 wounded; among the other ranks,
492 were killed and 1073 wounded. Of the XVIIIth, two officers were
wounded, four men killed and six wounded.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Though the French lost the
day, only twelve thousand of their men fell; and the only trophies of the
victory left in the hands of the Allies were sixteen guns, five hundred
prisoners, and many standards.</p>

<p>Three days after the battle the Duke resumed the siege of Mons, where
the Royal Irish were among the regiments of the covering force, and when
the fall of the fortress brought the campaign to an end, the XVIIIth returned
to its usual winter quarters in the town of Ghent.</p>

<p>Though no great battle occurred in 1710, the army in Flanders was by no
means idle. As Marlborough failed to induce Villars to try conclusions with
him in the field, he began to prepare for a future invasion of France by the
successive capture of the fortresses of Douai, St Venant, Bethune, and Aire.
The XVIIIth was in the besieging force at Aire, where the small garrison
defended itself gallantly for nearly ten weeks, not surrendering until it had
lost about 1400 men and inflicted nearly five times as many casualties on the
attackers. Nothing is known of the work done in this siege by the XVIIIth;
Stearne and Parker contented themselves with recording that owing to the
capture of a convoy food was very scarce in camp,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and that the regiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
had three officers killed and five wounded, with about eighty casualties among
the other ranks.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>During the winter of 1710-11 the French made gigantic efforts to protect
their country against the threatened invasion, and threw up fresh lines,
which ran from Namur to a point on the English Channel a few miles south
of Boulogne, using rivers and canals, swamps, and artificial inundations as
barriers against the general whom they feared so greatly. Before Marlborough
was ready to open the campaign of 1711, his trusted friend and
invaluable colleague, Prince Eugene, was recalled to Austria with a large
body of troops, but though left with forces greatly inferior in numbers to
those of de Villars, he resolved to carry out the first task he had already
set himself, the capture of Bouchain. As this fortress was protected by
the new lines, which were far too strong to be carried by force, the Duke
determined to decoy Marshal de Villars from the opening in the works at
Arleux, where he intended to cross. He advanced and retired; threatened
first one part of the lines and then another; issued contradictory orders;
pretended to be cast down at the loss of a weak detachment intentionally
thrown away as a bait to his adversary; simulated alternately rage, dejection,
rashness; and deceived not only the French spies in his camp, but
also his own army, who began to fear that their beloved “Corporal John”
had lost his judgment. By acting apparently like a madman, but really
with the profound skill of a great master of war, he lured de Villars forty
miles to the westward of Arleux, and on the morning of August 4, ostentatiously
reconnoitred the Marshal’s position, explaining in unusual detail to
the generals who accompanied him the part each was to play in the assault
which was to be delivered on the morrow: then he returned to camp and
issued orders for the coming battle. At tattoo the word was passed to strike
tents and fall in at once, and in an hour the troops were in motion. At first
they thought they were merely taking up ground for the attack next day,
but when hour after hour they plodded steadily eastward, they were fairly
puzzled until, just before dawn, the message ran down the column: “The
cavalry have reached Arleux and have passed the lines, and the Duke desires
that the infantry will step out.” And step out they did! They forgot the
fatigue of the fifteen miles they had marched already with heavy muskets on
their shoulders and fifty pounds’ weight upon their backs, and without a halt
for rest or food trudged manfully over an apparently endless plain. When
the sun grew hot the work began to tell, and it became a question of the
survival of the fittest. The weaker men dropped exhausted on the ground,
first by scores, then by hundreds, and later in the day literally by thousands;
but without stopping to help their comrades, those soldiers who still had
the strength to keep their places in the ranks set their teeth and staggered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
on, determined not to be beaten in the race by the French, whose horsemen
they could see on the other side of the lines hurrying in the same direction as
themselves. Early in the afternoon the leading battalions reached Arleux
and reinforced the cavalry, who were already in possession of the entrance
to the works. The XVIIIth came up about 4 <span class="fs70">P.M.</span>; apparently the discipline
and the marching powers of the regiment had brought it there fairly intact,
but when the men realised that the prize was won and Arleux safe in the
Duke’s hands, the reaction, inevitable after so prolonged a strain, set in, and
half of the Royal Irish collapsed, dead beat and unable to walk another yard.
Barely fifty per cent of the infantry had kept up with the army in this
forced march, when nearly forty miles was covered in eighteen hours.
Numbers of men were found dead from exhaustion, and it was fully three
days before all the stragglers had rejoined the Colours.</p>

<p>Marlborough now laid siege to Bouchain, and handled the covering force
so well against de Villars’ superior numbers that the French failed to interfere
with his operations, and on the 13th of September had the mortification
of seeing the garrison surrender. The investing force was desperately hard
worked during the siege. For thirteen days consecutively the Royal Irish
marched and dug trenches all day, and at night stood to their arms, ready to
fight at any moment. “This,” says Parker, “was the greatest fatigue I ever
underwent at any one time of my life.” Though the French surrendered
before the breach was stormed, they inflicted heavy losses on the besiegers,
whose casualties amounted to 4018, of which 1154 were among the fifteen
British battalions employed in the siege. The Royal Irish were fortunate:
only four officers were wounded, and about forty of the other ranks killed or
wounded.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> It is said that an officer of the XVIIIth, whose courage was as
high as his stature was low, was nearly drowned in wading across a deep
inundation, so he had himself hoisted on the shoulders of the biggest of the
grenadiers of his party, and when safely landed at the foot of the parapet
led an assault upon the enemy’s works.</p>

<p>The capture of Bouchain was the last service the Duke of Marlborough
was allowed to render to his country. Political intrigues had long been
directed against him, and when he returned to England in the autumn he
was coldly received by Queen Anne, insulted in the House of Lords, prosecuted
for peculation by the House of Commons, and deprived of all his
offices. Nay, more, to such a height did party pamphleteers rouse popular
indignation against him, that the General “who never fought a battle that
he did not gain nor sat down before a fortress he did not take” was forced
to go to the Continent to escape from the jeers of the London mob. Even
before his fall, the Ministers in power had begun secret negotiations with
Louis, by which England was to desert her Allies and make a separate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
peace with France; and when the Duke of Ormond, his successor in command
of the British forces in Flanders, joined the army in the spring of
1712, he understood that he was on no account to cross swords with de
Villars. During several months the British troops were in a very miserable
position; for being still, at least in name, part of the allied army, to the supreme
command of which Eugene had now succeeded, they followed its operations, but
in a novel and humiliating capacity: they were no longer chief actors, but
spectators&mdash;soldiers whom their Government would not allow to fight; and
when Ormond announced to them that the suspension of hostilities between
England and France was signed, the news filled them with profound grief.
In July they turned their backs upon their former comrades and returned to
Ghent and Bruges, after a gloomy march past Douai, Tournai, Bouchain,
Lille, and Oudenarde, places which they had helped to take, but to which
the Dutch garrisons now contemptuously refused them admittance.</p>

<p>After twenty years of almost uninterrupted fighting, every army requires
careful handling at the beginning of peace, but more especially one sore at
the ill-treatment of its beloved Chief, sorer still at the loss of its honour by
its desertion of its comrades in the time of need. Ormond did not manage
his men well, and neglected their commissariat; the garrison of Ghent lost
their discipline, listened to the words of agitators, and formed a mad scheme
to rise; loot and burn the town, and then disperse over the Netherlands.
The plot was discovered, but two or three thousand men seized part of the
town, where they barricaded themselves, holding out until field-guns were
brought against them. Soon after this mutiny was put down the troops
were withdrawn to England, but the Royal Irish and another regiment were
left to garrison the town until political questions regarding it had been
settled. Their detention at Ghent gave them the opportunity to see Marlborough
once more, for when he passed through the town at the end of
1712 the whole garrison was on foot to do him honour.</p>

<p>To many of the officers and men of the XVIIIth Ghent must have been
more familiar than their own homes in Ireland, for they had wintered there
for many years during the war, and did not finally leave it until the autumn
of 1715, when the regiment returned to England. A few months later it
was quartered at Oxford, where “the scholars and the soldiers did not
agree,” until the officers ordered their men to leave their weapons behind
them when they went out at night, taking instead stout cudgels with which
to teach the undergraduates good manners. This stopped the trouble, and all
was quiet until, on the Prince of Wales’ birthday, the officers lit a bonfire
outside the Post Office, and then went to supper. While they were at table
stones began to come in through the window; a number of soldiers rushed to
the defence of their officers, and broke the windows of the house from which
the supper party had been pelted. Then arose a furious row: the townsmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
turned out; so did the soldiers from their quarters, and headed by a Lieutenant
of grenadiers, who “was a little elevated,” a mass of Royal Irishmen
went through the town breaking every window they could reach that was
not illuminated in honour of the Royal birthday. Patrols were sent out to
stop the window-breaking, but it is possible they were not very zealous&mdash;at
any rate, much damage was done before the rioting was stopped. The Dons
announced that they would have every officer in the regiment cashiered for
this insult to the University, and solemnly complained to the Privy Council,
who at once asked for “reasons in writing,” or their equivalent at the beginning
of the eighteenth century. Then the House of Lords debated the
matter at great length, and finally decided in favour of the officers, charging
the University with disloyalty for not celebrating properly the Prince of
Wales’ birthday. Thus the affair ended without detriment to the regiment,
and to the great benefit of the Oxford glaziers who had to replace £500
worth of broken glass.</p>

<p>In January, 1712, Lieutenant-General Ingoldsby died. Brigadier-General

<span class="fs55">THE SECOND SIEGE OF GIBRALTAR&mdash;THE SIEGE OF OSTEND&mdash;LEXINGTON&mdash;BUNKER’S
HILL.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">Less than three years after the Royal Irish returned from the Low
Countries they found themselves again on foreign service, this time in the
south of Europe. During the war of the Spanish Succession there had been
much fighting in the Mediterranean, where Gibraltar, and Port Mahon in
Minorca, one of the Balearic Islands, had been captured by England, whose
possession of these two fortresses was confirmed by the Peace of Utrecht.
When this peace was signed every nation hoped that for many years there
would be no more wars on the Continent; but very soon relations between Spain
and Austria became so strained that the British Government decided to send
a squadron to the Mediterranean, to support Austria if Spain attacked her
Italian possessions, and to reinforce the garrison of Minorca. Among these
reinforcements were the Royal Irish, who, less fortunate than some of the
regiments in Minorca, were not selected to serve as marines in our short but
successful campaign off the coast of Sicily.</p>

<p>In 1727, the little world of Port Mahon was startled by grave news
from the mainland. Spain still smarted under the loss of Gibraltar:
every Spaniard looked upon the presence of the red-coats on the Rock
as an affront not only to his nation but to himself, and was prepared to
risk much to recover the fortress. For the second time since the XVIIIth
had been quartered in Minorca, Spain, regardless of the fact that she was not
at war with England, was making preparations to recapture Gibraltar. On
the first occasion, in 1720, though peace had been restored between the Courts
of Madrid and of St James, the Spaniards, under the pretext of reinforcing
their garrison at Ceuta, assembled a large number of troops near the fortress,
laid violent hands upon a hundred British merchant ships then lying in
the ports of southern Spain, and forced their crews to carry warlike stores
to the bay of Algeçiras. Gibraltar at that moment was in a deplorable condition&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
regiments were weak; there were only two officers of field rank in
the garrison, as the seniors were at home, many of them without leave; the
guns were few in number and bad in quality, and there was only fourteen
days’ supply of food in store. The place was in such imminent danger that
Colonel Kane, then Governor of Minorca, was ordered to come to the rescue
with every man who could be spared from his command. When he and his
reinforcement of five hundred men<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> arrived off the Rock, he found it threatened
by three hundred Spanish transports, escorted by six galleys, each
manned by 500 slaves, and three 60-gun Maltese war vessels, hired to take
part in the attack. The appearance of the four or five men-of-war with the
Minorca contingent frightened away the Maltese, and the Spaniards returned
to Ceuta without firing a shot. Now, seven years later, great preparations
for war were again on foot&mdash;a fleet of trading vessels was employed in transporting
guns, ammunition, and stores from Cadiz to Algeçiras, where as many
as forty ships arrived in a day; large numbers of troops were assembled, and
the peasants of Southern Andalusia were swept together to serve as labourers
in the siege. Our Government, however, was under the impression that the
Spaniards meditated not a siege but a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de main</i>, and in December, 1726,
warned the authorities at Gibraltar to be prepared for “a sudden push on
the sea line by scaling ladders, encouraged by the weakness of the garrison.”
The bearer of this important message was not sent from England by a swift
frigate, but was left to make his way to Spain as best he could; landing
at Malaga, he chartered a ship to take him to Gibraltar, but was captured
on the voyage by a Spanish man-of-war and thrown into prison. The
despatches, however, were saved and duly reached their destination; Kane
was once more summoned from Minorca, and with a regiment on the point of
returning to England reached Gibraltar in February, 1727. Doubtless the
XVIIIth was deeply disgusted at being left behind, but in a few weeks came
the turn, not indeed of the whole regiment, but of a portion of it, to share
in the honours of the defence.</p>

<p>According to the memoirs of Marshal Keith, a Scottish soldier of fortune,
who before he rose to eminence in the service of Russia held a commission in
the Spanish army, Kane did not arrive a moment too soon, for there was but
a slender guard at the landward gate, and the Spanish soldiers were allowed
to come into the town without being searched for arms. A surprise would
have been easy, but the fortress was saved by a strange exhibition of pride.
Count de las Torres, who commanded the Spaniards, haughtily said that
“would the English give him the town, he would not enter it but by the
breach.” In the middle of February his troops, 20,000 strong, took up positions
at San Roque, and in order to provoke hostilities began to throw up a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
battery on the western beach. General Clayton, who was acting Governor at
the time, thereupon wrote to de las Torres in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Having observed this morning that your Excellency has opened a
trench in order to attack this fortress, which act I hold to be contrary to
the treaties existing between our sovereigns, no declaration of war yet
having reached my knowledge, I therefore inform your Excellency, that if
you do not forthwith order the works to cease I shall be obliged to take
necessary measures in consequence. I transmit this to your Excellency
by my secretary, to whom I beg a reply may be delivered.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Jasper Clayton.</span></p>
<p class="fs90">“<span class="smcap">Gibraltar</span>, <em>February 22nd 1727</em>.”</p></div>

<p>To this letter the Spaniard replied&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I received your Excellency’s letter of to-day’s date, and regarding
the trench which has been opened as you say to attack the city
of Gibraltar, I hereby answer, that what has been done has been on our
own ground, to fortify those places where our batteries might be of good
service, and as there belongs nothing to that fortress beyond its fortifications,
as appears by the very treaties your Excellency alludes to; and
your Excellency having taken possession of the towers within our jurisdiction,
your Excellency may be fully assured that unless they are
immediately abandoned I will act in the manner your Excellency insinuates
to <em>me</em>, acquainting you at the same time that for besieging the fortress
works less distant will be constructed, as you will learn in due
time.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Count das Torres.</span></p>
<p class="fs90">“<span class="smcap">Campo de Gibraltar</span>, <em>February 22nd 1727</em>.”</p></div>

<p>This truculent answer clearly meant war, and so Clayton understood it;
but anxious to do nothing to precipitate hostilities, he contented himself for
the moment with firing one shot over the battery as an intimation that work
must cease. For an hour he held his hand: then, as the Spaniards wholly
disregarded the warning, his guns opened upon them. Thus commenced the
second of the series of sieges in which British troops have successfully defended
Gibraltar against heavy, sometimes well-nigh overwhelming odds. The
first, begun a few months after our capture of the Rock, lasted from October,
1704, to April, 1705; the second continued from the 22nd of February till the
23rd of June, 1727; the third, or Great Siege, lasted nearly four years, from
the 16th of July, 1779, to the 5th of February, 1783.</p>

<p>In 1727, the Spaniards attacked from the land side only; their navy took
no part in the operations, which were exclusively directed against the North
Front and the defences of the Rock from the extremity of the old Mole to
Willis’s Battery. At the beginning of the siege the garrison had only sixty
guns in position, the heaviest being 32-prs., and as “most of the ordnance was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
old and worn out, more casualties occurred from the bursting of guns than
from the enemy’s fire.”<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> The Spaniards, on the other hand, brought into action
ninety-two guns and seventy-two mortars, many of them the best and most
modern of their day. De las Torres lost no time in opening his trenches.
During the night of February 22nd-23rd five battalions of infantry, a brigade
of engineers, and a thousand peasants started work on the first parallel, which
ran from the Devil’s Tower on the eastern beach along the base of the Rock
to the inundation. Next night two thousand of the enemy were moved northwards
into ground dead to the guns of the batteries, but not to those of two
British men-of-war which, under cover of the darkness, had anchored off the
east of the isthmus connecting the fortress with the mainland, or, in other
words, the neutral ground. As soon as it was light the sailors brought
their guns to bear upon these troops, raking their ranks from end to end, while
from the top of the Rock the soldiers hurled down upon the Spaniards live
shell, hand-grenades, and stones. The enemy retreated in confusion and with
great loss, but de las Torres, after driving away the men-of-war by an overwhelming
artillery fire, threw up batteries so completely commanding the
anchorage on the east of the isthmus that further flanking attacks of this
nature became impossible. Under a heavy cannonade from the garrison, the
Spaniards worked without intermission, and in spite of heavy and continuous
rain which flooded their trenches and produced much sickness among their
men, gradually completed and unmasked many formidable batteries, some of
which were within a hundred yards of the Rock.</p>

<p>Throughout the month of March, before further reinforcements began to
arrive from England and Minorca, the British troops suffered greatly from
fatigue. The guards and piquets were very heavy, absorbing a daily average
of 1200 rank and file, and a thousand men were constantly occupied in mounting
guns and strengthening the defences. These working parties were commanded
by officers of the line, who were struck off all other duty and received
half a crown a-day extra pay. The men also drew sixpence a-day extra, and
“were assisted by the Jews, who were employed in taking ammunition to the
batteries and clearing the ditch of the rubbish beaten down from the upper
works by the enemy’s shot; these unfortunate Israelites received no pay, and
for some time were utterly useless, being paralysed with terror when under
fire.”<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Some of them, perhaps to revenge themselves for this forced labour,
joined in a conspiracy among the “undesirable” element in the civil population
to open the gates to the enemy. The plot was discovered, and punished
in the rigorous fashion of the day&mdash;two Moors, the chief agents of the
Spaniards, were put to death, and after their bodies had been flayed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
skins were nailed to the gates of the fortress as an object lesson on the
penalties of unsuccessful treachery.</p>

<p>The elements during the siege were strongly in favour of the British,
for such deluges of rain fell in April that the Spaniards’ trenches again
became untenable and their cover was destroyed. Until the damage could
be made good the opening of the great bombardment was necessarily postponed,
and during the respite two battalions arrived from home on the 7th
of April, and a fortnight later four transports, escorted by the <i>Sole Bay</i>,
brought five hundred troops, detachments from the corps stationed in Minorca.
How many men the Royal Irish contributed is not known; but as Cosby,
their colonel, was in command of the whole contingent, it is natural to
suppose that the regiment was largely represented. England’s command of
the sea enabled her to reinforce at will, and in the beginning of May two more
battalions reached Gibraltar from home, raising the strength of the garrison
to about 5500 non-commissioned officers and men. With them came Lord
Portmore, the Governor, who was on leave when the siege began: though
quite an old man he had refused to plead his age and infirmities as an excuse
for evading his duty, and now returned to take his share in the defence. As
soon as the Spaniards had finished their batteries and mounted their guns,
they opened a tremendous artillery fire, which was kept up for fourteen days
without intermission. During every hour of this time seven hundred projectiles
were hurled against our works, and to use the words of an eyewitness,
“we seemed to live in flames.... Attempts feeble in comparison to the
resistless storm of shot and shell that tore over the walls of the fortress, were
made to check this murderous fire in vain, guns were everywhere dismounted,
and as quickly as they were replaced were again destroyed. In vain the men
with dauntless courage threw themselves upon the ramparts and worked to
repair the shattered parapets, the heavy shot tore away whole tons of earth
and buried the guns beneath the ruins. Butts filled with sand and bound
with fascines were heaped together as some covering from the artillery, but
they were no sooner in position than they were swept away.”<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>The strain of this bombardment, said to have been greater than any
recorded in the previous history of artillery, proved more than the Spanish
ordnance could stand. By the 20th of May the brass guns began to droop at
the muzzle, the iron guns to burst, and ammunition to run short. Gradually
the enemy’s fire died down, and when there were but nineteen pieces left in
action against them the British restored their shattered works, and mounting
thirteen new guns and more than a hundred mortars poured upon the
Spaniards a storm of projectiles almost equalling that which had scourged
the defenders of the Rock. By dint of tremendous exertions a hundred guns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
were placed in position at the beginning of June, and then the tables were
turned, for this mass of ordnance opened upon the Spaniards with such a
crash that not a single gun was able to reply; the trenches became a heap
of ruins; the parapets of the batteries took fire, and the magazines blew up.
The first day’s cannonade drove the enemy from their forts, and gradually the
whole line of works was completely knocked to pieces. On the 23rd of June
the news reached Gibraltar that a suspension of hostilities had been arranged
between the Governments of England and Spain: all fighting then ceased;
the soldiers had played their part, and it was now for the diplomatists to settle
the differences between their respective countries. The British losses were
remarkably small. Five officers were killed or wounded; in the other ranks
69 were killed; 49 died from wounds or disease, and 207 were wounded. It
is not known how many of the XVIIIth were injured, as the casualties of the
Minorca contingent are given as a whole. To the Spanish army, on the other
hand, the siege proved very costly. Fifteen officers were killed, 42 wounded:
of the other ranks 346 were killed, 1119 were wounded, and more than 5000
died of sickness or were permanently invalided by the hardships they had
undergone. No less than 875 Spaniards deserted during the siege, some of
whom surrendered to our piquets and brought much useful information to the
Intelligence officers of the garrison.</p>

<p>When the siege was over, the detachment of the XVIIIth rejoined headquarters
at Minorca, where the regiment remained until 1742. Nothing would
have been known of the life of the Royal Irish during this period had not
copies been preserved of a curious correspondence between Major Gillman,
who was in command, and Major-General Armstrong, the Colonel of the
regiment.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> The officers were greatly disturbed at the quality of the recruits
received from home, and Gillman in 1729 thus reports on a recently joined
draft of sixteen men. “They are the worst I ever saw; two of them the
officers would not draw for: one of them wanting above half of his right
foot, the other having his backbone and ribs of both sides distorted in a
prodigious manner, by which means he is an object of compassion, both of
which are to be sent back to England at the expense of the person that
recruited them.”</p>

<p>Two years later Gillman again entreats that recruiting should be properly
conducted.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I beg leave to assure you that you have a corps of captains that has
the credit of the Regiment entirely at heart and will begrudge no expense
in supporting it on all occasions therefore I am thoroughly convinced you
will give such necessary orders to the person or persons that are to recruit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the regt, that they receive no bad or old men upon any account whatever.
The standard of the regt, is 5′ 7″ without shoes.... I entreat your
further assistance by getting a few fine fellows at home proper for the
Grenadier Company let the expense be ever so great which I’ll pay with
pleasure, and if two or three beautiful men fit for sergeants <em>to</em> said
Company could be sent over I’ll pay them sergeants’ pay until they are
provided for because two of the sergeants and the three Corporals are
the bane of the Company and not in the least fit to appear under arms
but with disgrace.”</p></div>

<p>The next letter (November 20, 1736) recommends that a commission
should be granted to Sergeant John Millner, the author of the history of
the war in the Low Countries to which frequent reference has been made in
<a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter II</a>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I beg leave to recommend to your favour on this occasion Sergt.
Millner and if it meets with your condescension I am ready to pay down
the money for him. I am thoroughly convinced that when so good a
man has the honour of being known to you you’ll not in the least begrudge
any favours that you may be pleased to lay upon him which he
will always own in the most grateful manner imaginable.</p>

<p>“As I have mentioned to you in mine of 30th August of the absolute
necessity the regiment lies under that it is high time that a Proper Person
should be thought of to discharge the duty of Adjutant for the reasons
therein mentioned. I assure you I know of no person so proper in the
regiment to discharge that duty as Sergeant Millner, who is very willing
to do it <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gratis</i>, provided it is for your advantage or any other commands
you should be pleased to lay upon him, as you may judge by his journal
he wrote of the late war in Flanders to which I find you were pleased to
be one of the generous subscribers.</p>

<p>“I should not take the liberty of recommending this poor man to you
if I had not sufficient reasons to be thoroughly sensible he is capable of
discharging any duty that his superiors are willing to employ him on, and
has on all occasions in a very particular manner merited the esteem of all
the officers he has had the honour of serving under, as you may see by
the generous subscription in his favour, a copy of which I send you
enclosed, by which you will plainly see good generous Kane has not
forgotten the (illegible? regiment) always desiring to be a subscriber on
the like occasion.”</p></div>

<p>In January, 1737, Gillman reports the loss of a subaltern, who can hardly
be said to have been cut off in the flower of his youth.</p>

<p>The gem of the collection, however, is contained in a letter of introduction
given by Major-General Armstrong to Major Gillman, in favour of a young
officer just posted to the regiment.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right fs80">“<span class="smcap">London</span>, <em>13th June 1737</em>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;The bearer hereof Ensign Stanhope, son of the Right Hon.

<p>Armstrong died in 1742, and was succeeded as colonel of the regiment by
Colonel Sir John Mordaunt, K.B. On its return home in 1742 the regiment
was quartered in the West of England until the spring of 1744, when it was
sent to Fareham to guard prisoners taken in the wars we were then waging
with the Spanish and the French. In 1739 a trade dispute with Spain had
produced a conflict memorable only for our miserable and costly failure to
take Cartagena, a flourishing settlement on the Caribbean Sea, in the part
of South America then belonging to Spain, and now the Republic of
Columbia. Soon afterwards a great war broke out on the Continent of
Europe between France and Spain on the one side and Austria on the
other. Various German States joined the Franco-Spanish alliance, while
England, Hanover, and Holland sent contingents to the help of Austria.
At Dettingen George II. gained a victory over the French in 1743, but
two years later his son, the Duke of Cumberland, was defeated at Fontenoy,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
where the magnificent courage and brilliant local success of the British
and Hanoverians were nullified by the apathy, cowardice, or jealousy of
the Austrians and the Dutch, who after Cumberland had actually forced
his way into the French camp sullenly refused to advance and support
his column at the moment when victory was within his grasp. Before
the news of this glorious, though disastrous day reached England, the
Royal Irish had been warned for service abroad, and formed part of a
small column which reached Cumberland in the middle of May. Welcome
as this reinforcement was, it did not nearly fill the gaps caused by the
slaughter at Fontenoy, where the casualties among the British and
Hanoverian infantry amounted to 32 per cent, the former losing 3662, the
latter 1410 officers and men. With his weakened force Cumberland could
not stand up against the French, and as far as most of the English regiments
were concerned, the rest of the campaign of 1745 was spent in
entrenching defensive positions, and then, under the pressure of the enemy’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
manœuvres, abandoning them, only to repeat the experience farther to the
rear, while the French, in greatly superior numbers, gradually reduced the
fortified towns of Flanders. Some of these places Marshal Saxe, the French
Commander-in-Chief, took by force of arms; others capitulated without
resistance, and in August he was able to detach a considerable body of
troops to attack Ostend, a vital point in Cumberland’s lines of communication
with England. The garrison was hastily reinforced, the last corps to
arrive being the Royal Irish, who on the 9th of August embarked at Antwerp
on “billanders,” as the boats used for inland navigation were called, and
dropping down the Scheldt to Flushing transhipped into sea-going vessels
for Ostend. The town was in a wretched condition and quite unfit to
stand a siege; the Austrians, to whom it then belonged, had allowed the
fortifications to fall into disrepair; the artillery was deficient in guns and
stores of every kind, and the three thousand infantry, insufficient for the
perimeter they had to guard, were not soldiers of the same nation commanded
by generals of their own army, but detachments of British, of Austrians,
and of Dutch&mdash;men with no common language and dissimilar in discipline,
habits, and sentiment. These differences, sufficiently serious in themselves,
were accentuated by the undisguised contempt of the English for the Allies
who had left them in the lurch at Fontenoy. Nor were these the only
difficulties. An essential part in the scheme of defence was the flooding of
a large tract of country round the town, but this measure had not been
carried into effect, for the Austrians, unwilling to ruin the peasants by
inundating the villages and farms, were so slow in issuing the necessary
orders that when at length labourers were sent to open the sluices, the
French were close at hand and prevented the working parties from accomplishing
their task. To have defended Ostend successfully would have taxed
the powers of a great leader of men, and none arose to snatch the reins of
office from the hands of the governor, a veteran grown old and decrepit in
the Austrian service. The General appointed to command the British arrived
after the town was invested, and was unable to make his way into Ostend;
an Austrian officer of the same rank, de Chanclos, was more fortunate, but
though he acted as confidential adviser to the Governor he had not the
time, even if he possessed the capacity, to weld the heterogeneous garrison
into a good fighting force.</p>

<p>On the same day that the Royal Irish left Antwerp a French General,
Löwendahl, appeared before Ostend with 21,000 good troops, a numerous
artillery, and 5000 pack horses, laden with fascines for the siege; he finished
his first parallel on the 14th of August, and next day threw up batteries
on the shore to enfilade the harbour and to keep at a distance the British
frigates which hovered about the port. After thus cutting off Ostend from
communication with England he pushed on his works with vigour, and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the 18th twenty pieces of artillery and ten or twelve mortars opened a
violent cannonade which lasted for four days almost without intermission.
The defending troops were greatly overworked; half of them were constantly
at the batteries or in the covered way; the remainder had to be ready to
turn out at a moment’s notice, and as there were no casemates or bomb-proofs,
the only shelter for the men when off duty was in barracks and
private houses, which rapidly crumbled under the French projectiles. The
officers were rather better off, for they shared with the sick and wounded
the cellars of the town-hall, made shell-proof with walls of sandbags. All
ranks were vilely fed; the officer of the XVIIIth who wrote the anonymous
‘Continuation of Stearne’s Journal’ says “the beef stank, the biscuits
were full of maggots.” There were not enough artillerymen to man the
guns; when the gun carriages were knocked to pieces by round shot there
were none in reserve to replace them, and by the end of the siege only
seven pieces of ordnance remained fit for use. Three days after the bombardment
began de Chanclos wrote gloomily to Cumberland&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This town is a heap of ruins ... the great fatigue, and entire
absence of quiet, night or day, owing to bomb-shells and cannon-balls, put
the garrison into very bad humour, and it is really not saying too much
to call it bad. I might even add that one must be an Englishman to
put up with what we are suffering here! The enemy is sapping up to
the covered way and is attacking on our weakest side. Nearly all
our cannon have been dismounted, many artillerymen have been killed
and the survivors decline to work the guns.”</p></div>

<p>He thus reported the loss of the town:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right fs80">“<em>August 24.</em></p>

<p>“On the night of the 22nd a general assault was made on our covered
way by fifteen companies of Grenadiers, supported by two battalions.
The point chosen was the sea front at low water. We repulsed the
enemy more than once, killing and wounding 500 men, and making
prisoners of 2 captains, a lieutenant, and 30 odd grenadiers. At day
break I assembled my commanding officers to obtain their opinion as
to our situation. Everyone agreed that we could not hope to hold out
for more than a few days.”</p></div>

<p>As soon as this informal Council of War was over de Chanclos ordered
his drummers to beat the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chamade</i>; and after obtaining a truce for the burial
of his dead he offered to capitulate on condition that the garrison should be
allowed to march out of Ostend with all the honours of war, and be escorted
safely to Austrian territory.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> In proposing these terms he forgot to specify<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the Austrian fortress to which his troops were to be conveyed, the route
by which they were to travel, and the date on which they were to arrive.
The French General, however, noticed these omissions, and with suspicious
alacrity agreed to Chanclos’s terms: the garrison marched out with all due
pomp, fully expecting to be escorted at once to the nearest Austrian town;
but soon the troops learned to their deep disgust that the French had discovered
the flaws in the articles of capitulation, and were about to send
them by a devious route to Mons. This was considered very sharp practice,
not at all worthy of an honourable enemy; but the King of France had every
reason for wishing to deprive England as long as possible of the services
of the defenders of Ostend, for the young Pretender, Charles Edward, had
landed in Scotland; the rebellion, known in history as “the ’45,” was rapidly
gaining strength; and Government was clamouring for the return from
Belgium of the British troops. After a short halt at Ghent, they were
crowded into canal boats for an involuntary “personally conducted” tour
through Belgium, and from the description left by an officer of the regiment
it is clear that the most ardent sight-seers could have extracted no
pleasure from this journey.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We were escorted by a party of Horse, and constantly attended by
agents of theirs (the French) whose business it was to inveigle away our
men, and by large promises (of which these rascals were not sparing)
induce them to desert; as our progress was rendered designedly slow
we were only drawn by the boors of the country a very few miles a
day. A French trooper with his carbine was placed at the head of
each billander, who did not fail to threaten the poor wretches with
firing at them whenever they did not pull to please them. We continued
on board this incommodious embarcation seventeen days, when
we arrived in Tournai, where we disembarked.”</p></div>

<p>As Tournai is about thirty-two miles from Mons, the column should
have begun its march very early in the morning to have covered the distance
in one day, but the escort refused to move till 8 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span>, and consequently it
was 7 o’clock in the evening before the British arrived at St Gillain, a
fortified village held by the Austrians as an outpost to Mons, a few miles
farther on. Alleging that in bringing the garrison of Ostend to this outpost
they had fulfilled their undertaking, the French halted, ceremoniously
saluted the Colours of each regiment, and then retired. The British officers
were at a loss to understand why the French had left the column at
St Gillain instead of escorting it to Mons, but in a few minutes they learned
the reason from an Austrian general whom Cumberland had sent to meet
them. A large body of the enemy’s troops were lurking in the neighbourhood,
with orders to attack St Gillain if the regiments from Ostend remained there,
and if they attempted to reach Mons to capture or exterminate them on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
march; the only hope of escape, therefore, was to start at once on the
chance that the intercepting force had not already taken up its position.
Without a moment’s delay the ranks were re-formed, the pans of the muskets
re-primed and the bayonets fixed; then in profound silence the weary troops
plodded along the causeway leading towards Mons. “As it was a moonlight
night we could command a view of the country about us, and as we every
moment expected the enemy we continued our march in the greatest order;
not a whisper was to be heard; the officers who were present will always
remember with pleasure the discipline and good disposition every regiment
showed on that occasion. At eleven we arrived at Mons, where owing to
some mismanagement we waited two hours before we got admittance.”<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> This
delay was obviously caused by bad staff work, but the arrangements of
the French were no better. The enemy, confident that the Ostend troops
would be too tired to push on that night, left no patrols to watch the
exits from the village, with the result that 20,000 Frenchmen took up a
position astride the causeway an hour after the refugees had found safety
within the walls of Mons. For three weeks the Royal Irish were blockaded
in this fortress; then thanks to the manœuvres of a relieving force they
“slipped out” at dead of night, and in a few days reached the neighbourhood
of Brussels.</p>

<p>Affairs in Scotland were now going so badly that nearly every English
soldier was recalled from the Continent to defend England against the Jacobite
invasion. The XVIIIth landed at Gravesend early in November, and after
various changes of quarters embarked for the seat of war in Scotland in the
spring of 1746. On the voyage a vexatious incident occurred by which the
regiment was prevented from taking any active part in the Scotch campaign.
While off the coast of Yorkshire the transports, containing the 12th, 16th,
XVIIIth, and 24th regiments, were warned that three French men-of-war
were cruising in the neighbourhood; the ships ran for safety into the Humber,
where they remained until the report was proved to have no foundation; and
owing to this delay the Royal Irish did not reach Leith until the day after the
rebels had been finally crushed at the battle of Culloden. For two years the
regiment was stationed in Scotland, in the summer making military roads in
the Highlands, in the winter quartered at various towns, and when the treaty
of Aix-la-Chapelle put an end to the war the XVIIIth was ordered to Ireland,
after it had been placed on a peace footing by reductions so sweeping that the
establishment of each company was fixed at two sergeants, two corporals, one
drummer, and twenty-nine private soldiers.</p>

<p>In 1755, our relations with France were again strained to breaking point:
in America the French garrison of Canada and the British garrison of the
colonies on the Atlantic coast were waging fierce, though unofficial war in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
forests south of the river St Lawrence; and as the conflict seemed likely to
spread to Europe, troops were withdrawn from Ireland to Great Britain.
Among the regiments hurriedly brought across St George’s Channel was the
XVIIIth, rapidly recruited up to a strength of seventy-eight men per company.
But the “Seven Years’ War” brought no laurels to the Royal Irish,
who were condemned to inactivity in the United Kingdom, while other corps
were winning fame on the Continent and in the West Indies, in Canada and
the Philippine Islands. In 1767, four years after peace was declared, the
regiment was ordered to Philadelphia, the capital of Pennsylvania, one of the
oldest of our American colonies. The beginning of the lamentable quarrel
between the mother-country and her English-speaking over-sea provinces
found the Royal Irish still quartered at Philadelphia, but in 1774, Boston, the
chief town of the colony of Massachusetts, became such a hotbed of disaffection
that General Gage, who commanded the troops in British North America,
reinforced its garrison with troops drawn from less disloyal centres of population.
Among the regiments ordered to Boston was the XVIIIth, at that time
very weak in numbers, for hardly any recruits had arrived from home, and
those enlisted at Philadelphia were “bounty-jumpers,” who deserted at every
opportunity.</p>

<p>The causes of the breach between England and the provincials, as the
colonists were then called, have been discussed in innumerable histories, and
are far too complex to be dealt with in the chronicles of a regiment. It is
enough to say here that the dispute began about questions of taxation and
trade; the home Government was stupid, slow, and overbearing in its dealings
with the provincials, who on their side were petulant, aggressive, and
impatient of control. Many of the young Americans believed that as all
danger of an attack by France had been removed by the British conquest of
Canada, they would be better off as citizens of a republic than as subjects of
King George. Both sides were unable to regard the matters at issue from
a point of view other than their own: the English Government failed to
appreciate the restlessness and desire for expansion natural to young and
growing communities of British stock; the provincials were equally unable to
realise how slowly new ideas penetrated into the brains of the governing
classes at home.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 1775 the whole of Massachusetts was seething with
scarcely veiled rebellion, and though the inhabitants of Boston itself were
overawed by the presence of Gage’s troops, the rural population was so hostile
that it was unsafe for officers to go any distance into the country without
a strong and well-armed escort. The excitement was increased by the action
of the provincial Parliament, which, issuing a proclamation urging all able-bodied
men to arm themselves and join the militia, began to collect warlike
stores at various places in the colony. One of these depôts was at Concord, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
village twenty miles from Boston; Gage determined to burn its contents, and
on the night of the 18th of April sent a raiding party of eighteen hundred
men upon this errand of destruction. Under command of Lieutenant-Colonel
Smith the flank companies&mdash;<em>i.e.</em> the grenadiers and light infantry<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>&mdash;of
the 5th, 10th, XVIIIth, 23rd, 38th, 43rd, 52nd, and 59th regiments started
from Boston before midnight, followed a few hours later by Lord Percy with
a supporting body composed of the whole of the 4th and 47th regiments, the
battalion companies of the 23rd, and ten companies of marines. As it was
known that the provincials’ intelligence department was well organised, every
precaution was taken to keep the expedition secret; but though the gates of
the town had been closed early in the evening and the troops assembled
silently at dead of night, their movements were reported by the anti-British
faction in Boston, and as they marched through the darkness the ringing of
bells and firing of guns warned them that the alarm had been given throughout
the countryside. At daybreak the advance-guard ran into a small body
of militia at Lexington: there was a parley, followed by a skirmish in which
several provincials were hit and the remainder retreated in disorder. Smith
lost no time in pushing on to Concord, and while his grenadiers began to
demolish the stores some of the light companies guarded the approaches to
the village.</p>

<p>So far the raid had been successful, but before describing how rapidly the
tables were turned against the troops, the reader must realise with what
manner of men Smith’s detachment was about to try conclusions. The
original settlers in Massachusetts were of picked British stock; the large
majority had left the old country to escape from the restraints imposed by
the Stuarts upon liberty of conscience, while others had sought in the New
World a freer and more adventurous life than England could afford. The
mere fact that these men and women had the courage to leave their homes
and friends to face the horrors of the unknown, proved them to be above
the average in courage and steadfastness of purpose; and the hard life of
pioneers; the incessant struggle with nature in a rude climate; fierce fights
with the Red Indian savages, who tortured their captives before killing them;
long hunting expeditions in vast and trackless forests; life on lonely farms
where every man was thrown on his own resources&mdash;all had contributed to
develop a race of over-sea Britons as formidable to their enemies as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
would have been valuable to the Empire if they had been treated with tact,
consideration, and justice. It was not in pioneering alone that the New
Englanders had found vent for their restless energy; they had taken part in
many of our expeditions during the first half of the eighteenth century. In
the disastrous failure at Cartagena a considerable number of New Englanders
shared in our defeat, and carried home with them a sorry report of the
conduct of the army; a contingent of colonists with justice claimed a large
share in the glory of the capture of Louisburg, the French Gibraltar at the
mouth of the St Lawrence; and in all the interesting, though now forgotten
fights between the English and the French in the country round Lake
Champlain American volunteers fought side by side with the regular troops.
Thus when the provincials determined to take up arms against England, many
of the men who later became generals of note in the republican army had
served their apprenticeship to war under the Colours of the mother-country.
They had studied our drill; they understood our tactics; they knew the
merits and demerits of our soldiers, and very soon learned how best to meet
our slow and cumbrous movements with their imperfectly trained volunteers,
who at the beginning of the War of Independence had many points in
common with the Boers of 1899. Both were ardently patriotic; self-reliant to
a fault; wholly undisciplined and obeying no order that did not appeal to
them as individuals; both fought in bands of friends and neighbours, not
infrequently commanded by the local preacher. In one respect, however, the
Boers and the American colonists differed widely. In none of their encounters
with the British did the burghers ever hold their ground with determination
when things had begun to go badly with them, while at Bunker’s Hill, the
first real battle of the revolutionary war, the provincials “fought to a finish”
with such grim tenacity that, had our army been engaged, not with a raw
militia, but with European regular troops, its dearly bought success would
have been extolled as a feat of arms equal to any in the annals of England.</p>

<p>While Smith’s grenadiers were looking for the warlike stores, the light
infantry outposts were attacked and driven back into Concord by a very
superior force of provincials, who from far and wide had collected to do battle
with the red-coats. Boys, full-grown men, greybeards almost tottering to the
grave, turned out with splendid enthusiasm from the hamlets of Lincoln,
Bedford, Carlisle, and Chelmsford, and surrounding the village like a swarm
of bees, set themselves to sting the intruders to death with musketry. Smith
determined to retire, and as his column filed out of Concord it became the
target of sharpshooters lurking behind houses and log fences and in the woods
bordering the rough track that led to Boston. In vain were flanking parties
thrown out to keep the enemy at a distance from the main body; the provincials
disappeared among the trees and then reappeared farther down the
road, using their firearms with deadly effect. The soldiers replied so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
vigorously that ammunition began to fail them, and as it was impossible
to charge a foe who had no formation and whose position was only indicated
by isolated puffs of smoke on every side of the column, Smith retreated as
fast as possible towards Lexington, losing men at every step. His troops
straggled into the village so worn out by hunger and thirst, so demoralised
by the biting fire of an almost invisible enemy, that when they saw Lord Percy’s
detachment drawn up to protect them they flung themselves on the ground, so
badly shaken that the supporting troops had to form square round them.
For a time there was a lull in the firing; but when more contingents
joined the provincials they re-opened such a vigorous fusilade that Percy
decided to lose no time in retiring to Boston, fifteen miles away. He
handled with much skill the regiments which had accompanied him, falling
back from position to position so steadily as to keep his pursuers in some
check; and notwithstanding the ever-increasing volume of fire with which
reinforcements from Cambridge and Dorchester enabled the colonists to
torment him, by nightfall he succeeded in bringing the shattered column
safely into Boston. When the casualty returns were prepared, it was
found that this disastrous little expedition had cost us in killed, wounded,
and prisoners, nineteen officers and two hundred and fifty of the other
ranks&mdash;a total to which the flank companies of the XVIIIth contributed
two private soldiers killed and four wounded,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> while the losses of the
provincials were rather less than a hundred fighting men. The news of
the American success spread like wildfire throughout New England; colony
after colony threw in its lot with Massachusetts, and in a few days between
sixteen and twenty thousand provincials had assembled for the blockade
of Boston, then garrisoned by eleven battalions, all under strength, the
weakest of all being the Royal Irish, who on the 25th of June could only
muster two hundred and fifty-seven of all ranks. Although there was a
British fleet at anchor in the bay, Gage could do nothing until more soldiers
arrived from England, and by the time the long-expected reinforcements
reached him Boston was closely invested by the Americans.</p>

<p>When the first emigrants to Massachusetts decided on the site of their
principal town they selected an almost land-locked bay of the Atlantic,
where there was good anchorage and shelter from the winter gales. This
bay was almost bridged by two peninsulas, which from opposite shores jutted
so far towards each other that at the nearest point they were only five
hundred yards apart. Boston was built on the southern of these headlands;
on the northern, the village of Charlestown nestled at the foot of an underfeature
of the semicircle of low hills enveloping the bay. From Bunker’s
Hill, as the southern end of this underfeature was called, Boston lay within
cannon-shot; but neither side attempted to occupy this important position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
until Gage’s reinforcements arrived. Then the British General determined
to seize it, but the Americans, acting either by intuition or on information
from their spies in Boston, forestalled him. On the evening of the 16th of
June twelve hundred men paraded on the common at Cambridge, attended a
prayer-meeting, and then started on an enterprise the object of which was
known only to the most senior of their officers. The column was commanded
by Colonel Prescott, who had so greatly distinguished himself at
the capture of Louisburg from the French during the Seven Years’ war
that the home Government had offered him a commission in the regular
army. Many of the men in his ranks had seen powder burned in earnest,
and though their muskets were heavy and unwieldy, they had learned to
use them in the pursuit of big game, where an ill-aimed bullet may cost the
hunter his life. By the glimmer of dark lanterns Prescott led his men
across the isthmus connecting the Charlestown peninsula with the mainland,
then crossed Bunker’s Hill and halted on a lower ridge, Breed’s Hill, where
he quickly traced the lines of a redoubt. To the provincials digging was
no novelty, and they plied pick and shovel so silently and so assiduously
that when the day broke the sailors on board the nearest man-of-war saw
to their amazement an entrenchment, six feet high, standing where overnight
there had been nothing but smooth pasture land. The ships lost no
time in opening fire, and the colonists, unable to reply to our big guns, were
growing unsteady when Prescott hoisted himself on to the parapet where,
under a heavy but ill-directed cannonade he sauntered up and down,
giving directions to his working parties and encouraging those men whose
courage was not as steadfast as his own. With such an example before them
none of the militia flinched; the redoubt grew apace, and was practically
finished before the troops in Boston were ready to attack it. But though
Prescott had every reason to be satisfied with the temper and industry of
his detachment, his situation was a desperate one, and had Gage availed
himself of all the resources at his command, not one of the twelve hundred
adventurers would have made his way back to the provincial camps.
The British had command of the bay; vessels of light draught could sail
close to any part of the peninsula; the isthmus, the only possible line of
retreat for the Americans, was low, sandy, and less than two hundred
yards in width. Gage could have landed behind the entrenchments, and
have attacked the Americans simultaneously in front and rear; he could
have cut off their retreat and starved them into surrender by fortifying
himself upon the isthmus, or by stationing gunboats on either side of it, he
could have made it absolutely impassable by cross fire. These schemes were
suggested to him, but neither he nor any of the British army were in
the mood for scientific fighting, and he decided to regain the prestige lost
at Concord and Lexington by a direct frontal attack upon Breed’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Hill.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Four complete battalions and twenty flank companies, including the
grenadiers and light infantry of the Royal Irish, were rowed across to the
Charlestown peninsula&mdash;the right wing under General Pigot was composed
of the provisional battalion of light infantry, the 38th and 43rd regiments;
in the left wing were the provisional battalion of grenadiers, the 5th
and 52nd regiments, commanded by General Howe. While the troops were
landing on ground well out of range of the Americans the officers had time
to study the position they were to carry. It was a strong one: a gentle
slope, covered with long grass and cut up by a series of fences calculated
to throw advancing troops into disorder, led up to the redoubt and to
a breastwork, which ran for a hundred yards towards the enemy’s left.
Between the end of this breastwork and the sea was a gap, held by a
detachment posted at the foot of Bunker’s Hill, where the only cover was
a low stone wall, on which hay was piled to give it additional height. The
total frontage occupied was about six hundred yards, defended when the
fight began by fifteen hundred men and six pieces of artillery.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> The British
brought between two thousand and two thousand five hundred troops into
the field, for in addition to the units already mentioned the 47th regiment
and a battalion of Marines came into action during the fight.</p>

<p>At three o’clock in the afternoon Howe, who was the senior officer on
the Charlestown peninsula, gave the order to advance. At first the movement
was covered by the fire of eight pieces&mdash;field-guns and howitzers,
which had been ferried across from Boston, but soon the supply of cannon-balls
ran out, and as the officer in charge of the artillery reported that
a marsh prevented his pushing on to within grape-shot range of the enemy,
the infantry for a long time were unsupported by the guns. After the
regiments had deployed, the light infantry was directed against the enemy’s
left, while the grenadiers, 5th and 52nd, with the 38th and 43rd in second
line, were to storm the breastwork and the redoubt. The day was intensely
hot, and the soldiers, burdened with heavy knapsacks, three days’ rations,
cartouche-boxes, ammunition, bayonets, and muskets weighing fifteen pounds,
mounted the hill slowly though in good order. They were allowed to open
fire too soon, and their volleys, delivered with perfect precision, were almost
ineffective. The provincials wished to reply while their enemies were a
long way off, but their leaders knew better than to allow such a waste of
ammunition, and while some threatened to cut down the first man who
discharged his firelock without orders, others ran along the top of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
parapet kicking the muzzles into the air. It was not until the red-coats were
within fifty or sixty yards that the Americans were allowed to shoot, and
then their well-aimed musketry was so terrible that the whole British line
recoiled before it to the bottom of the hill. Howe re-formed his troops, and
again led them up the slope, only to be hurled backwards once more with
a loss so heavy that the glacis of Breed’s Hill looked more like the breach
of a fortress after an assault than an ordinary battlefield. But though they
had twice failed to reach the works of the Americans neither Howe nor
his men were beaten, and the General had the moral courage to order a
third attack, while the soldiers</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“had that in them which raised them to the level of a feat of arms to which
it is not easy, and perhaps not even possible, to recall a parallel. Awful as
was the slaughter of Albuera, the contest was eventually decided by a
body, however scanty, of fresh troops. The cavalry which pierced the
French centre at Blenheim had been hotly engaged but, for the most
part, had not been worsted. But at Bunker’s Hill every corps had been
broken; every corps had been decimated several times over; and yet the
same battalions, or what was left of them, a third time mounted that
fatal slope with the intention of staying on the summit. Howe had
learned his lesson, and perceived that he was dealing with adversaries
whom it required something besides the manœuvres of the parade ground
to conquer. And to conquer, then and there, he was steadfastly resolved,
in spite of the opposition which respectfully indeed, but quite openly,
made itself heard around him. He ordered the men to unbuckle and lay
down their knapsacks, to press forward without shooting, and to rely on
the bayonet alone until they were on the inner side of the wall....
The officers who had remonstrated with him for proposing to send the
troops to what they described as downright butchery, when they were
informed of his decision, returned quietly to their posts, and showed
by their behaviour that in protesting against any further bloodshed
they had been speaking for the sake of their soldiers and not of
themselves.”<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p></div>

<p>Prescott had begun to ask for reinforcements of men and ammunition
early in the day, but, as was to be expected in a volunteer army chiefly
officered by amateurs, the staff arrangements were so bad that very few
troops and no ammunition reached him during the action. Thus when Howe
for the third time hurled himself at the redoubt, none of its defenders had
more than two rounds left. These last shots were not wasted, for as the
troops rushed with fixed bayonets towards the work a venomous fire brought
nearly every man in the front rank headlong to the ground; but without a
check the ranks in rear surged over the parapet, and falling-to with the cold
steel drove the provincials in confusion out of the redoubt. With empty
muskets and with few bayonets the Americans could do little at close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
quarters, but many fought stubbornly as they retreated, admirably covered
by the men on Bunker’s Hill, who, though heavily cannonaded by the fleet,
held their ground until their comrades from Breed’s Hill had shaken off
pursuit. This engagement cost our provincial kinsmen 115 killed and 300
wounded, while of the old-country men 19 officers were killed and 70
wounded; in the other ranks 207 were killed and 758 wounded&mdash;a total
of 1054 casualties.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> The enormous proportion of losses among the commissioned
ranks was due to the good shooting of picked marksmen, who
were kept supplied with loaded weapons by their neighbours. These sharpshooters
devoted themselves to picking off the officers, whose glittering
gorgets not only revealed their rank, but gave an excellent target at which
to aim. Of the part played in the action by the grenadier and light companies
of the Royal Irish no particulars have been preserved; nothing is
known beyond the fact that three privates were killed and an officer, Lieutenant
W. Richardson, and seven privates wounded.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Compared to the
carnage in some of the flank companies, the losses of the XVIIIth were
insignificant, yet the actual percentage was high, for in June, 1775,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> the
companies of the regiment only averaged twenty-six of all ranks, and though
the grenadiers and light infantry were usually a little stronger than the
battalion companies, it is doubtful whether between them they brought more
than sixty-five or seventy men into the field.</p>

<p>Although Gage’s dearly-won victory secured to the British the possession
of the Charlestown peninsula, and thus guaranteed them against bombardment
from Bunker’s Hill, it did not improve the situation in other respects.
Soon after the battle Washington was elected to the command of the
provincial army, and so closely invested Boston that the garrison began
to suffer from the want of fresh food. At first the daily ration of salt
pork and peas was occasionally varied by fish, but this source of supply
was cut off by the American general, who dragged a number of whale-boats
overland from the neighbourhood of Cape Cod to the head-waters of one of
the rivers flowing into the bay, and manned the flotilla with sailors, of whom
there were many in his ranks. With this mosquito fleet he effectually
stopped all fishing operations, and under the very guns of our warships<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
captured small craft, and seized the sheep and cattle grazing on the islands
in the bay. That such things were possible shows the depths of inefficiency
to which our fleet on the American station had sunk in 1775; supine and
stupid as were the generals, they seemed models of talent and energy when
compared with the admirals with whom they were expected to co-operate.
The want of proper food produced much illness, especially among the
wounded, whose diet in hospital was the same as that of the men at duty;
and the mortality was great. Coal ran so short that wooden houses and
churches were pulled down for firewood. Small-pox broke out and claimed
many victims. The duties, heavy everywhere, proved particularly trying at
the outposts, for the provincials, ignoring the rule of war that piquets are
not to be fired upon wantonly, used to amuse themselves by forming parties
to stalk and shoot down the sentries as they paced their beats. Beyond these
occasional skirmishes there was no fighting; at first the gunners cannonaded
the enemy’s position, but with so little success that the general decided to
waste no more powder in teaching the Americans how to stand fire. As
month after month passed in misery and inaction, the soldiers, badly fed,
thoroughly dispirited and profoundly bored, grew moody, dirty, careless
about their dress, while discipline was only maintained by the stern sentences
of the courts-martial which awarded punishments of four hundred, six
hundred, and even a thousand lashes.</p>

<p>When the Cabinet realised that Boston was in great want of food they
sent out many ships filled with stores of every kind. But the ill-luck which
dogged the British throughout the American war prevented the arrival of
these vessels. Some were lost at sea; others were blown by a tempest to the
West Indies; while others again, laden with cannon and mortars, muskets,
flints, and much powder and shot fell into the hands of the Americans, who
under Washington’s fostering care were rapidly forming a national fleet.
These munitions of war were not the only provincial spoils: a daring raid
against isolated forts on the Canadian frontier secured a large number of
guns, and early in March, 1776, Washington began to bombard Boston with
British ordnance, and took possession of high ground to the south of the
town, which from want of men neither Gage nor his successor Howe had
been able to include within their lines. This position commanded the harbour,
and the Admiral warned the General plainly that unless the soldiers could
recapture it the men-of-war and transports would be obliged to put to sea.
Thereupon Howe, who had long realised that it was impossible to maintain
himself in Boston, ordered its evacuation, and on the 17th of March, with the
nine thousand troops remaining to him and eleven hundred loyalists who
refused to remain behind, he set sail for Halifax in Nova Scotia, in ships
so overcrowded that many valuable stores had to be left to fall into
Washington’s hands, while much of the officers’ heavy baggage shared the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
same fate. The Americans did not hinder the embarkation, for Howe had
given out that if the bombardment was resumed he would set fire to the
town, and Washington, to whom the threat was reported by his spies, allowed
him to depart in peace. The men-of-war, after seeing the troopships safely
out to sea, hung about the coast of Massachusetts for a time, but effected
nothing, and then were ordered to other parts of the theatre of war.</p>

<p>The XVIIIth had been so worn down by privations and misery at Boston,
that it was ordered home to recruit. The men still fit for active service
were drafted into other regiments, while the officers, non-commissioned
officers, and invalids of the Royal Irish returned to England in the course
of the summer of 1776. The XVIIIth was not actively employed during
the remainder of this war, which, beginning with our attempt to suppress
the rebellion in North America, developed into a struggle for existence
against the combined forces of France, Holland, and Spain; for these countries,
seeing that our resources were heavily taxed by the struggle in America, and
desirous to pay off old scores, took up arms against us. For a time we lost
the command of the sea, and could not reinforce Cornwallis when he was
besieged at Yorktown by Washington’s provincial troops and a large body of
French regular soldiers. After a gallant defence, Yorktown fell, and with
the lowering of Cornwallis’s flag passed away Britain’s last hope of reconquering
her rebellious provinces. By the peace of 1783, England was
compelled to recognise the independence of the United States, as her revolted
colonies now styled themselves; to restore Florida and Minorca to Spain, and
to cede to France the West Indian islands of St Lucia and Tobago.</p>

<p>From 1776 to 1783, the Royal Irish were stationed in England and in the
Channel Islands, where their officers drilled and disciplined the recruits to
such purpose that when the young soldiers were suddenly called upon to
perform a most unpleasant duty they were thoroughly equal to the occasion.
Early in 1783 the XVIIIth was in Guernsey, where one of the regiments of
the garrison had acquired an evil reputation for insubordination. This corps
(long since disbanded) suddenly broke out into open mutiny, and after
coercing its colonel into promising them privileges entirely subversive of
all discipline, apparently settled down; the officers, thinking the trouble was
over for the moment, went to their mess-room and sat down to dinner, when
a shower of bullets came rattling about their ears. They took cover under
the table, but the would-be murderers mounted to windows from which
they could pour plunging fire into the mess-room, and were shooting vigorously
when a sergeant advised the officers to make a dash for the gate of
the fort. They did so, and by great luck escaping unhurt by the volley with
which their appearance in the barrack-square was greeted, hurried into the
town to give the alarm. Two of their number, however, could not run, and
found shelter in a coal cellar! As soon as this outbreak was reported, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
local militia was turned out, and the XVIIIth ordered to parade forthwith;
the fort was surrounded; the drums sounded a “parley”; but the mutineers
at first declined to treat, and then demanded that they should be disbanded
and sent back to their homes at once. When the Lieutenant-Governor
attempted to reason with them, these madmen fired at him and next turned
their muskets on the troops. Then more infantry came up, followed by some
guns; and there seemed every prospect of a sharp fight, when the mutineers
suddenly lost heart, piled arms, and marching quietly out of the fort, surrendered.
Happily none of the bullets found its billet among the Royal
Irish, who were greatly praised by the military authorities for their good
behaviour, and the States (the local parliament) of Guernsey presented a
hundred guineas to the non-commissioned officers and privates of the XVIIIth
as a tangible proof of gratitude for their services on this occasion.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1783 the regiment sailed for Gibraltar, where it was
stationed for the next ten years.</p>

<span class="fs55">THE WAR WITH THE FRENCH REPUBLIC: TOULON&mdash;CORSICA&mdash;EGYPT.
THE NAPOLEONIC WAR: THE WEST INDIES.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">During the early phases of the French Revolution the British Government
assumed an attitude of strict neutrality in the internal affairs of France, and
to this policy it adhered until January, 1793, when the excesses of the Jacobins,
culminating in the judicial murder of Louis XVI., compelled England to
join the coalition of Continental Powers which had taken up arms to restore
order in France, and to safeguard their own dominions, threatened, and in
some cases actually invaded by the troops of the Republic. The outbreak of
war found the British army in a deplorable condition; it had in no way
recovered from its disasters in America, and was “lax in its discipline, entirely
without system and very weak in numbers. Each colonel of a regiment
managed it according to his notions or neglected it altogether. There was no
uniformity of drill or movement; professional pride was rare, professional
knowledge still more so.... Every department was more or less inefficient.
The regimental officers, as well as their men, were hard drinkers, the latter,
under a loose discipline were addicted to marauding and to acts of licentious
violence.”<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">physique</i> was often as defective as the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">morale</i>; some regiments
were composed of lads too young to march, while in others the majority
of the rank and file were old and worn-out men. A few thousand troops were
hurried off to join the forces of the Allies who faced the French in Holland,
and a fleet was sent to the Mediterranean under Lord Hood, with orders to
co-operate with the adherents of the Monarchy, who were still numerous in
the south of France. After Hood passed Gibraltar he bore up for Toulon, then
as now one of the principal French naval ports.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> In its harbour and dockyard
lay many warships, commanded by Royalists who hated the Revolution and
all its works, and manned by sailors many of whom agreed with the political
opinions of their officers. As large numbers of the civilian population in the
town shared his views, the Royalist admiral, in the hope of rescuing his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
country from the anarchy into which it was plunged, took the extreme step
of entering into negotiations with Hood for the occupation of the port by the
British. The horror inspired by the Revolution must have been deep indeed
to induce an officer of high rank and unblemished reputation to think of such
an arrangement with a nation regarded by every Frenchman as the hereditary
enemy of his race. Since the Normans after conquering France had overrun
and subdued England, hostilities between the two countries had been frequent,
almost incessant; we had often raided the French coasts, and for a long time
our kings held as their own the western half of France. In the hundred
years immediately preceding the outbreak of the Revolution the divergent
policy of their rulers had plunged the two countries into a series of five wars:
their armies had encountered each other on innumerable battlefields in Germany
and the Low Countries, in Spain, Canada and the West Indies: their
fleets had met not only in the Mediterranean, the Bay of Biscay, and the
Channel, but in parts of the ocean as remote as the Gulf of Bengal and the
Caribbean Sea; and bands of French adventurers in the service of the native
princes of India had fought with the troops of the East India Company on the
plains of Hindustan. Very bitter must have been the feelings of the Royalist
officers when they agreed to make over to Hood the forts, the arsenal, the
shipping, the docks, and the town of Toulon itself, on the understanding that
this national property was to be held in trust for the son of Louis XVI., to
whom it was duly to be restored when he ascended the throne. The French
men-of-war were to be dismantled, but as a concession to sentiment, and to
show that Toulon was not a conquered town but still formed part of the
Kingdom of France, the white flag of the Bourbons was to float over its walls.</p>

<p>On August 27, 1793, Hood, who had been joined by a Spanish squadron,
took possession of the forts. The landing party consisted of from twelve to
fifteen hundred marines and soldiers who were serving on board the ships.
There was no officer among them of rank higher than a captain; they had no
tents, or stores, or field-guns, and even had they possessed the latter, there
were no engineers or artillerymen to plan a battery or to lay a gun. Though
the troops met with no active opposition, the attitude of many of the French
sailors was so threatening that Hood decided to get rid of as many of them
as he could, and selecting four of the least serviceable French vessels, he
unshipped their guns and ammunition, and packed into them five thousand of
the most troublesome republican seamen, with “safe conducts” for the French
ports on the Atlantic seaboard. Having thus disposed of these “undesirables,”
Hood applied to those of the Allied Powers whose territories lay in the basin
of the Mediterranean for help to hold Toulon against the Republicans who
were gathering against him, and by the beginning of November he had collected
a very heterogeneous force of about 16,000 men. When our Ministers
learned that Toulon was in the hands of the Allies they promised to send<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Hood large reinforcements; but neither the importance of the place as a base
of operations against the Republicans, nor the difficulty of holding its land-locked
harbour were adequately appreciated at home; and when more troops
were required for our contingent in the Low Countries, for an expedition
against the coast of Brittany, and for a raid upon the French islands in the
West Indies, the expected reinforcements dwindled to seven hundred and fifty
men from Gibraltar, who reached Toulon on the 27th of October. At the beginning
of the war the regiments were so weak that this handful of troops included
the XVIIIth Royal Irish,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> the second battalion of the Royals, and detachments
of Royal Engineers and Royal Artillery. The exact strength of the
XVIIIth is not known, but as on the 25th of June, 1793, there were only two
hundred and eighty-three officers and men at the Rock, and as a certain
number of sick were left in hospital when the Royal Irish went on active service,
the captains must have commanded companies no larger than the sections
of the present day. The reinforcements from Gibraltar raised the strength
of the British to about 2000 of all ranks; their allies consisted of 6500
Spaniards, 4700 Neapolitans, 1500 Piedmontese, and about the same number
of French Royalists.</p>

<p>An army made up of contingents from several nations is necessarily less
effective than one formed of soldiers of the same race. Hereditary ill-feeling,
professional jealousy, and the want of a common language combine to lessen
its value as a fighting machine, unless the General-in-Chief possesses a personality
as commanding as that of Marlborough or Wellington. At Toulon
none of the senior officers of the Allies were men of genius, and it is doubtful
whether even a great soldier, with so curiously composed a force, could have
withstood the savage energy that Napoleon, then a young officer of artillery
on his first campaign, infused into the Generals commanding the besieging
troops. The contingents of the Allies were of very uneven value. The
British were excellent, though their courage was not yet thoroughly disciplined;
the Piedmontese were very good; the French Royalists, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
brave, naturally disliked to fight their republican fellow-countrymen, much
as they loathed their political principles; the Spaniards frequently deserted
their posts when threatened by a vigorous attack, and the Neapolitans were
cowards of the deepest dye. Sir Gilbert Elliot, the diplomatic representative
of Britain in the Mediterranean expedition, describes how a party of Neapolitans
behaved on outpost. After four of them had been killed in a skirmish,
the remainder sent to the officer in charge of the section “to beg to be
relieved as they were all <em>sick</em>!” With such allies it is not surprising to learn
that “no post was considered safe without a proportion of British troops, and
they were obliged to be divided and thin-sowed accordingly.”<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Whether
from genuine illness, from unfitness for the hardships of active service, or
from overwork, the sick list was enormous, and the Generals could never
count on more than 11,000 or 12,000 effectives&mdash;far too few for the heavy
duty they had to perform. To prevent the enemy from planting batteries on
the hills commanding the harbour, the Allies were forced to hold a perimeter
of fifteen miles, guarded by eight main works with a number of subsidiary
connecting posts; and nine thousand men were constantly employed at the
outposts, with a reserve of three thousand in the town, to overawe the disaffected
part of the population and to reinforce any threatened point.</p>

<p>Up to the time of the arrival of the XVIIIth there had not been much
fighting, for the French were engaged in mounting guns, and were not yet in
strength to attempt a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup-de-main</i>. When the Royal Irish landed they
were marched up to the front, but were engaged in no affair of importance
until the 30th of November, when they took part in a sortie against a large
battery placed by Napoleon himself on the Aresnes heights, from which one
of our principal works was commanded. The assaulting column, formed of
400 British, 300 Piedmontese, 600 Neapolitans, 600 Spaniards, and 400 French
Royalists, was commanded by General O’Hara, one of the staff at Gibraltar,
who had landed at Toulon with the XVIIIth. The instructions he issued
were explicit. When the troops reached the plain at the foot of the heights,
the column was to break into four detachments, the British on the left, and
on reaching the summit they were to capture the battery, occupy the heights,
and then stand fast; on no account whatever were they to follow the enemy
in pursuit. After making their way, first through a belt of olive-trees
intersected by stone walls, and then up a steep mountain cut into terraces of
vineyards, the Allies gained the crest, surprised the French, and drove them
headlong out of the battery. Had they remembered their orders the success
would have been complete, for the guns could have been rolled down the
height and carried back to Toulon; but unfortunately the men got out of
hand, and dashed madly after the retreating French down a valley and up a
hill on the other side, scattering in all directions as they pursued their flying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
foes. They had lost all vestige of cohesion when they were charged by formed
bodies of the enemy, whose counter-stroke changed our victory into a defeat.
General O’Hara was wounded and captured; and of the four hundred British
engaged, twelve officers and about two hundred other ranks were killed,
wounded, or taken prisoner. The survivors fell back to the battery and
attempted to hold it, but being unsupported by their Continental comrades
had finally to retreat into Toulon, though not before they had spiked six guns.</p>

<p>During the next fortnight the volume of the enemy’s fire increased daily;
fresh batteries were unmasked in various directions, and everything tended to
confirm the reports of spies and deserters that the French, now about 40,000
strong, were preparing for an attack in force. The preliminary bombardment
began at 2 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span> on the 16th of December, when Napoleon concentrated the fire
of five batteries upon Fort Mulgrave, one of the most important of the western
series of redoubts. It was held by a mixed force: a body of Spaniards
occupied the northern half of the work; the southern was in charge of a
detachment of British, under Captain W. Conolly, Royal Irish Regiment. By
the end of the day the redoubt was in ruins, with half its garrison of seven
hundred men disabled; at two o’clock in the morning of the 17th the French
advanced against it, but though in overpowering force, for half an hour they
made no progress till the Spaniards were seized with panic and left the British
in the lurch. The enemy had begun to occupy the northern end of the work,
when Conolly, though himself hard pressed, sent a subaltern and thirty-six
men to retake it. With splendid courage this handful of soldiers drove back
the Republicans, and for a time kept them at bay; but soon the weight of
numbers began to tell, the survivors of the detachment were forced backwards,
and at four o’clock the “remnants of the XVIIIth” were ousted from
Fort Mulgrave. An hour or two later the French, breaking through the line
of fortifications at a second point, carried Mont Faron, a hill 1800 feet high,
which from the north partly commands the harbour and the town. On the
enemy’s side of this mountain the slopes are steep and rocky; and as much
labour had been expended in increasing their natural difficulties, Faron was
considered so impregnable that only four hundred and fifty men were employed
to guard its two miles of frontage. At daylight every work upon this
hill was attacked and, though none of the British posts were driven in, the
French poured through the gaps left by the Spaniards and Neapolitans, and
established themselves upon the shoulder of Mont Faron from which Toulon
is overlooked.</p>

<p>A disaster such as this had long been foreseen by the senior officers of the
British land forces. General O’Hara, and his successor General David Dundas,
had frequently represented to Lord Hood the impossibility of making a
prolonged defence with so inadequate and so inefficient a garrison as that
at his disposal; they had pointed out that if one of the main works should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
lost there were no fresh troops with which to recapture it, and that once any
part of the line was pierced the harbour and the fleet would be exposed to the
enemy’s artillery; and they therefore urged that arrangements should be
made beforehand for the orderly and systematic evacuation of the place when
it became untenable. But Lord Hood was strongly prejudiced against soldiers:
throughout his career he had slighted their advice, and he took no steps to
prepare for the retreat which the Generals warned him was inevitable, with
the result that when all hope of holding the place was gone nothing was in
readiness for the retirement, and nearly the whole of the 17th was spent in
settling details with the naval and military officers of the different nations.
To organise the evacuation was no easy task; not only were there four
thousand sick and wounded to be embarked, but room had to be found on the
transports or the men-of-war for thousands of Royalists whom it was impossible
to abandon to the vengeance of their republican fellow-countrymen;
the French ships had to be burned or towed out of harbour, and the arsenal
and dockyard to be destroyed. After many hours of weary discussion it was
agreed that the embarkation of the troops should begin at 11 <span class="fs70">P.M.</span> on the 18th;
the least important posts were to be withdrawn early, others were to be held
to the last moment. The scheme, which required absolute obedience to orders,
was nearly wrecked by the Neapolitans, whose misconduct Elliot thus described
in a despatch to Government&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“ ... These arrangements were made on the 17th before dinner.
Without notice to any person concerned the Neapolitan officers packed up
their baggage, and crowded the streets and quays with their preparations
for departing on the evening of the 17th. Their baggage was actually
sent on board, their general actually embarked that evening, and the
troops, quitting every post where they were stationed, continued their
embarcation publicly from the quays of the town, from the evening
of the 17th to the middle of the next day. Their eagerness, impatience
and panic were so great on the 18th, in the forenoon, that the embarcation
of the inhabitants was rendered not only difficult but dangerous, the
Neapolitan soldiers firing on those boats which they could not get
admission to. Many of themselves were drowned in attempting to crowd
into the boats, and there was a temporary appearance of confusion and
insurrection in the town. The Neapolitan Admiral seems to have been
in as great haste as the military. He sailed long before either the British
or Spanish squadrons and, without waiting to make any arrangement
about either troops or refugees, pushed off for Naples, leaving a good
number of Neapolitan troops on board our fleet to find their way home as
well as they can.”<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p></div>

<p>Until nearly all the allied troops were embarked the British and Piedmontese
remained resolutely at their posts, which they did not quit until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
recalled into the town to cover the operations of the sailors, who were burning
the arsenal and setting fire to the French ships. When the outposts were
withdrawn the French crowded into Toulon, and by the light of the flames
shot heavily at the blue-jackets, busy at the work of devastation, in which
they were helped by a party of the XVIIIth, commanded by Ensign W.
Iremonger, one of the two land officers employed on this dangerous duty.
For a time a musketry fight raged; then at the appointed hour the soldiers
gradually withdrew to their boats, gained their ships, and in two or three
hours the whole of the allied fleet was safely out to sea. Though Hood’s
operations on land utterly failed to advance the cause of the Royalists, and
though he did not succeed in destroying the arsenal completely, or in burning
all the enemy’s ships, he undoubtedly inflicted a serious, though not a crushing
blow to the naval power of France in the Mediterranean by his operations at
Toulon. When he took possession of the town he found floating in its harbour
or building in its dockyard fifty-eight men-of-war of various sizes: thirty-three
he annexed or burned to the water’s edge, the remaining twenty-five he
was obliged to leave behind him, to become the nucleus of a new fleet. The
price paid in human flesh and blood for this success cannot be stated, for the
losses of the Allies are not to be traced, and the British returns, as far as they
were published in despatches, are incomplete, and in the case of the Royal Irish
do not agree with the muster-roll made a week after the evacuation. In it
appear the names of three sergeants, one corporal, and thirty-four privates who
were killed or died during the siege; and one officer, Lieutenant George
Minchin, two sergeants, two drummers, one corporal, and thirty-two privates
missing.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> In the unsuccessful sortie of the 30th of November twenty-four
rank and file of the regiment were wounded; how many were injured in the
daily fighting at the outposts and in the defence of Fort Mulgrave and Mont
Faron cannot be ascertained, but it is clear that the Royal Irish played a
distinguished part in the operations, and in proportion to their numbers lost
very heavily.</p>

<p>As soon as the allied fleet was clear of the harbour of Toulon it dispersed:
the Spaniards and the Neapolitans made sail respectively for the Balearic
Isles and Naples, while Hood put into the bay of Hyères, a few miles east of
Toulon, where he tried to evolve order out of the chaos produced by the
hurried embarkation of the troops, and to obtain fresh provisions of which he
was in great need. Unwilling to weaken himself by sending British vessels
to buy food in the ports of Italy and Spain, he employed upon this service
several of the French ships, which, in theory at least, were still under the
orders of the Royalist admiral. British infantry were sent on board them as
marines, the XVIIIth furnishing a strong detachment under Lieutenant Mawby,
who on going on board the <i>Pompée</i> found that she was still flying the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Royalist flag, and was commanded by French naval officers. The duty was
heavy, and the cruise must have been a very unpleasant one, for guards had
to be mounted in every part of the vessel to keep her crew from breaking into
open mutiny. In one respect, however, Mawby and his companions were
better off than their comrades at headquarters, for they escaped the overcrowding
caused by the presence of thousands of Royalists in the ships at
Hyères. Sir Gilbert Elliot mentions that in the cabin he shared with several
naval officers, twenty luckless French refugees, men, women, and children
slept huddled together on the floor; and if no better quarters could be
provided for the diplomatic representative of England, it is easy to imagine
that regimental officers must have been hideously uncomfortable.</p>

<p>At this time England had no possessions in the Mediterranean east of
Gibraltar, for Minorca, lost to her in 1782, was not recovered till some years
later. Yet to watch Toulon and the southern coast of France, and to encourage
the various Italian States to fight for their independence which was already
threatened by the armies of the Republic, it was essential that England should
possess an advanced naval and military base in the Mediterranean. Such a
post awaited us in Corsica, where the inhabitants had profited by the turmoil
of the Revolution to rise against their French masters, whom they had driven
into the north of the island. The garrison had flung themselves into the
fortified coast towns of Bastia and Calvi, and the works fringing the bay of
S. Fiorenzo, and the Corsicans soon realised that without professional soldiers,
cannon, and munitions of war, they could not hope to take these places, while
without a fleet it was impossible to prevent reinforcements from the mainland
reaching their enemy. When both parties to a bargain are eager to come to
terms negotiations are easy, and the islanders willingly agreed to become
subjects of George III., provided that a constitution framed on that of England
was granted to them. As soon as the arrangements for the annexation of the
island were completed Hood left his anchorage at Hyères, where for five
weeks the French had allowed him to remain unmolested, and made for the
bay of S. Fiorenzo, at the western base of the great northern promontory of
Corsica.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Driving the French from their defences, he forced them to fall back
on Bastia, their foothold on the eastern coast; then leaving some of the troops
at S. Fiorenzo, he sailed for Bastia, already closely blockaded by Nelson’s
frigates and cut off from communication with the interior by the Corsicans,
who excelled in all kinds of partisan warfare. Neither Hood’s ships nor the
troops accompanying them were at this time in a satisfactory condition: his
crews were so weak that he had tried to borrow sailors from the Neapolitan
fleet, but without success; and the soldiers numbered little more than two
thousand men, who were very ill provided for a campaign, as most of their
camp equipage, baggage, and knapsacks had been left behind at Toulon. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
board sat in Corsica to investigate the circumstances in which this loss&mdash;a
very heavy one to the men&mdash;had been incurred, and recommended that £2
should be paid to each sergeant and £1 to each private soldier, adding that
though this would not compensate the men for their kit, it was as much
as Government could be reasonably expected to give.</p>

<p>Though Hood, as a sailor, was unversed in the military branches of the
art of war, he decided after a reconnaissance of Bastia that it would be possible
for the troops to carry the defences by a sudden assault from the land side
of the town. Dundas, who though cautious by temperament was an
educated soldier of much experience, condemned the project as beyond the
powers of his small and ill-equipped force, and this difference of opinion at
once intensified the friction already existing between the Admiral and the
General. Unable to agree on a plan of operations, Hood and Dundas
summoned conferences and councils of war, at which no decision was reached;
and their relations became so strained that they ceased to meet, transacting
business by means of formal and acrimonious correspondence. Throughout
the army the question was hotly debated, and Bastia was reconnoitred by
many officers, the large majority of whom became converts to Dundas’s
opinions. Lieutenant-Colonel Wemyss, who commanded the XVIIIth, was
one of the few in favour of an attack, but his views do not appear to have
been supported by convincing arguments, for Sir John Moore (then
Lieutenant-Colonel Moore, 51st regiment) recorded in his diary that “Wemyss
conceives it would be mighty easy to take them” (<em>i.e.</em>, the heights commanding
the land fortifications), “but cannot explain how, and talks so like a
boy that little weight can be given to his opinion.”<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Hood’s conduct towards
the General and the troops became so intolerable that Dundas took the unjustifiable
step of resigning his command and returning to England. Not
long after his departure reinforcements reached the officer in temporary
command of the army, whose offer to co-operate in the operations was
contemptuously rejected by Lord Hood; and thus, when on May 24th the
garrison of 4500 men surrendered, the success was due to the Navy, whose
blockading vessels had fairly starved the French into submission, while,
with the exception of some artillerymen and the troops serving on the
warships as marines, the land forces were hardly employed in the reduction
of Bastia.</p>

<p>The only place in Corsica now remaining in the occupation of the French
was Calvi, a well-fortified town on the western coast. Lieutenant-General
the Hon. Charles Stuart, who on the day of the surrender of Bastia had
arrived from England to replace Dundas, lost no time in reorganising his
command, and then reconnoitred Calvi, where he was followed by Moore,
who had been placed in command of a corps termed “the reserve,” and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
formed of the flank companies of the Royal Irish, the 50th, 51st, and the
remains of the 2nd battalion of the Royals. Calvi was by no means an
easy place to besiege, for it was surrounded on three sides by the sea and
had good interior fortifications, with outer works of considerable strength.
About eight hundred yards west of the town stood the Mozello, a bomb-proof,
star-shaped fort, built of solid masonry and mounting ten guns;
north of this fort was a smaller battery, flanked by an entrenchment, and
to the east rose another battery of three guns. Two thousand yards south-west
of the town the fort of Monteciesco commanded the approaches from
the southward, which were also swept by the guns of two French frigates
anchored in the bay. But though these works were formidable, Stuart
considered that the “real strength of the defence lay in the height of the
mountains and the rugged, rocky country over which it was necessary to
penetrate. It was necessary to abandon regular approaches and to adopt
rapid and forward movements.” He accordingly decided to bombard Fort
Monteciesco with three 26-prs., and under cover of their fire to throw
up a heavier battery at night within seven hundred and fifty yards of the
Mozello. The labour of moving the guns, ammunition, and stores was
immense, for roads had to be cut up the sides of steep hills nine hundred
feet in height, and the cannon to be dragged by hand over the cliffs that
overhang the landing-place. At the end of June more troops were brought
round from Bastia; among them were the Royal Irish, recently reinforced
by the return of the <i>Pompée</i> detachment, which rejoined in time to share
in the fatigues and dangers of the siege.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 6th of July,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> the Royal Irish were ordered to
make a feigned attack on Monteciesco to draw the attention of the enemy
from Moore’s column, which was preparing to throw up the battery against
the Mozello. The ruse was successful; the XVIIIth showed themselves so
ostentatiously that the French not only turned all their fire upon them,
but reinforced Monteciesco with a body of men who had been posted on
the very spot where Moore proposed to place his guns. By dint of great
efforts the last of Moore’s 26-prs. was dragged into position just before
daybreak, thus raising the number of ordnance playing upon Calvi to
eleven guns and three mortars, whose fire forced the French to evacuate
Monteciesco and move their warships out of range. Stuart then bombarded
Mozello assiduously; the French replied with equal vigour; for some days
our shot appeared to make little impression on the fort, but on the 18th
of July the breach was reported to be practicable, and orders were issued
for its assault that night. To conceal the real object of his movements, he
arranged that an advance battery should be built in the night in order
that the French might think the concentration of troops was merely for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the protection of the working party. The task was entrusted to the 50th,
who, undiscovered by the enemy, threw up the battery, and then, to quote
the words of the despatch, “the Grenadiers, Light Infantry and 2nd Battalion
Royals under Lieutenant-Colonel Moore of the 51st Regiment and Major
Brereton of the 30th Regiment proceeded with a cool steady confidence
and unloaded arms towards the enemy, forced their way through a smart
fire of musketry, and regardless of live shells flung from the breach or
the additional defence of pikes, stormed the Mozello” ... while “Lieutenant-Colonel
Wemyss, equally regardless of opposition carried the enemy’s battery
on the left without firing a shot.” In Sir John Moore’s diary fuller details
of this spirited affair are to be found. The various corps assembled at
their rendezvous at 1 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span> on the 19th: the Royal Irish were to attack the
half moon (or Fountain) battery on the left, while “the reserve” stormed
the Mozello. In ground dead to the fort, though only two or three hundred
yards distant from it, Moore formed the grenadiers and light infantry
(among whom, it will be remembered, were the flank companies of the
XVIIIth) into a column of companies.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Each grenadier carried a sandbag, and we had a sufficient number of
ladders (about fourteen in all). Here we waited for the signal which was
to be a gun from the new battery. The General came to me about half-past
three. About this time some of the enemy’s sentries or piquets fired
upon the XVIIIth upon our left, and soon after the signal to advance
was given. The General kept for some time at the head of the Grenadiers.
A party of artificers a little in our front began to cut the palisades, but
we were upon them before they could effect it. Captain McDonald, who
commanded the Royal Grenadiers,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> and I got through the palisades first
at an opening made by our shot. The men instantly followed, and giving
a cheer, ran up to the bottom of the breach. We were annoyed both by
shot, hand-grenades, and live shells, which the enemy had placed on the
parapet and rolled over upon us. Luckily neither sand-bags nor ladders
were necessary. The Grenadiers advanced with their bayonets with such
intrepidity that the French gave way and ran out of the fort&mdash;and in
a moment the place was filled with the five companies of Grenadiers.
Two companies of Light Infantry had been ordered to move quickly
round the foot of the fort and get between the enemy and the town, but
the Grenadiers stormed so briskly that the Light Infantry could not
arrive in time: by this means most of them escaped.”</p></div>

<p>The Royal Irish lost no time in entrenching themselves in the Fountain
battery, and worked so well that when at daybreak the enemy opened with
grape and round shot the cannonade did them little harm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>Stuart had every reason for wishing to bring the operations to a close, for
though his casualties were small, bad food, excessive fatigue, and a pestilential
climate had so devastated the camp that by the middle of July two-thirds
of his men were in hospital, and the remainder were breaking down at an
alarming rate. The large number of sailors who were serving on shore under
Nelson were in equally bad case, and the necessity of watching the French
at Toulon made it impossible to replace them from the fleet. In the hope
that the loss of their principal outworks had shaken the spirit of the French,
General Stuart sent word to the garrison that he was prepared to offer them
favourable terms; but when Casabianca, their commander, refused to negotiate,
he pressed forward his siege-works so fast that on July 31, thirteen heavy
guns, four mortars, and three howitzers were in position within six hundred
yards of the walls of the town. So effective was their fire that on the 1st of
August Casabianca asked for a suspension of hostilities, undertaking to yield
in nine days if during that time he was not relieved from France, and as
no help arrived the nine hundred men of the garrison surrendered on the
10th. In recognition of their spirited defence of Calvi, which had lasted
for fifty-one days, they were granted excellent terms; they marched out
with all the honours of war; they retained their side-arms; and they were
sent back to France, free to serve against us again as soon as they pleased.
The capture of Calvi only cost the British ninety killed and wounded,
and the losses of the XVIIIth were proportionately small. Lieutenant W.
Byron, whose death assured to his young relative, the future poet, the
succession to the peerage, was killed; Lieutenant-Colonel D. D. Wemyss
and Lieutenant W. Johnston were wounded; five rank and file were killed,
one sergeant and seven rank and file wounded.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Yet so greatly had the
regiment suffered during the siege from exposure and malarial fever, that
when it marched into Calvi its effectives consisted of two officers, four
sergeants, and seventy-one rank and file, and though the capitulation brought
active operations to an end the losses by disease did not cease. Malaria
had taken so firm a hold of the Royal Irish that including those who were
killed or died of wounds or sickness during the siege, four officers, nine
sergeants, six corporals, and a hundred and fifty-five private soldiers perished
during the first nine months the regiment was in Corsica.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> The mortality
was at its height during the month of August, when seventy non-commissioned
officers and men died.</p>

<p>Nothing is known of the doings of the XVIIIth during the remainder of
our short occupation of Corsica, except that several of the officers were employed
on the staff: one of them, Major (afterwards Lieutenant-General Sir H. T.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Montresor, after acting as Governor of Calvi, was placed in command of a
battalion of islanders, one of the corps raised for local defence by Sir Gilbert
Elliot, who had been appointed Viceroy of Corsica by the Government at home.
The lives of the officers left at regimental duty must have been singularly
dull, as there was so little communication with England that letters or papers
rarely reached the island, and even the Ministry, apparently forgetful of the
existence of their new possession, often allowed months to pass without communicating
with Elliot. Some amount of cynical amusement, however, was
to be derived from studying the mental attitude of the population, who, at
first delighted to find themselves British subjects, soon grew weary of the
restraints of law and order enforced upon them by their new rulers. The
Corsicans watched with ever increasing pride the victories in Italy of their
young compatriot, Napoleon Bonaparte; they realised that the English and
their Allies made no headway against France on land, and they appreciated
the importance of Spain’s change of policy, when after deserting the coalition
against the Republic she placed her Mediterranean fleet at the disposal of our
enemy. They gradually came to the conclusion that in annexing themselves
to the British they had joined the losing side, and when the French troops
overran Tuscany and seized upon Leghorn, the Corsicans began to give Elliot
broad hints that they wished to see the last of him and his garrison of red-coats.
The presence of the French in Leghorn, the principal port of Tuscany,
was a direct menace to us in Corsica; and as a counterstroke Elliot threw
troops into Porto Ferraio, the capital of the little island of Elba, half way
between Bastia and Leghorn. To the Duke of Tuscany, part of whose
dominions Elliot had thus occupied, the Viceroy justified himself by pointing
out that as Tuscany had been unable to defend her territory on the mainland
she would have been equally impotent to keep the French out of Elba.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1796, the British Government, alarmed at the combination
of the French and Spanish fleets, determined to recall their forces from
the Mediterranean, and the order for the evacuation of Corsica was conveyed
to Elliot by a despatch, wherein the abandonment of the island was described
in the stilted language of the period as “the withdrawal of the blessing of
the British Constitution from the people of Corsica.” As a preliminary to
the general retirement the troops had to be concentrated at Elba; and the
embarkation of the garrison of Bastia, which included some, if not all, of the
Royal Irish, was effected in very dramatic circumstances. When Nelson
arrived off the port on October 14, he found the town in wild confusion: a
committee of virulent Anglophobists had seized the reins of power, and their
adherents were virtually masters of the place; British property had been
confiscated; British merchant ships were forcibly detained in harbour; a plot
was on foot to make the Viceroy a prisoner, and the General, de Burgh, had
withdrawn the garrison into the citadel, where they had been followed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
large numbers of armed men who insisted on falling in with the guards and
sentries at every post. By threatening to blow the town to pieces, Nelson
succeeded in releasing the captured shipping and in saving public and private
property valued at two hundred thousand pounds; but though the soldiers
and sailors slaved night and day their work was by no means finished when,
on the night of the 18th, news arrived that French troops had landed and
were marching rapidly on Bastia, while the Spanish fleet was reported to be
only sixty miles distant. Even Nelson realised that nothing more could be
done: the troops began to move down to the boats, while the guns were
spiked by Mawby, an officer of the XVIIIth, who with the grenadier
company of the regiment had just been brought back from detachment on
the neighbouring islet of Capreja. Though a heavy gale of wind was blowing
and the sea was very high every soldier was safely embarked; and not too
soon, for as the last boat pushed off from the shore the French advance-guard
began to enter the citadel.</p>

<p>The resources of Elba were insufficient to meet the requirements of her
suddenly increased population, and at first she drew largely from Piombino,
the port of the district known as the Maremma of Tuscany. By garrisoning
the town of Piombino and the villages in its neighbourhood, the French so
effectually cut off this source of supply that at the beginning of November
Elliot and de Burgh determined to make an effort to reopen communication
with the mainland of Italy, and sent a column, chiefly composed of the Royal
Irish, to drive the enemy from Piombino and the surrounding country.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> The
expedition is briefly mentioned by the Viceroy in a letter of November 6,
1796, where he says, “We take Piombino this evening. This will be the last
act of my reign, and in truth the measure of Porto Ferraio was not complete
without it. I shall then feel very happy about our supplies.”<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> No account
of the operations is to be found in the printed bulletins or among the
documents at the Record Office; but fortunately some details have been
preserved in the Royal Military Calendar, in a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">précis</span> of the services of
General Montresor. Brevet-Colonel D. D. Wemyss, XVIIIth, was in command
of the column which was composed of the Royal Irish,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> under
Montresor, then a lieutenant-colonel; two companies of de Roll’s Swiss
regiment, one of the many corps of continental mercenaries raised at that
time by Great Britain, and a detachment of artillery. These troops were
embarked on three frigates, which anchored off Piombino early on November
7; Montresor was at once sent on shore to summon the Governor, who after
some hesitation agreed to surrender, and without loss of time the soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
landed. While Wemyss was taking measures to secure Piombino and to
improvise transport for his men his heart must have sunk within him.
Outside the walls of the town there were hardly any signs of life; autumnal
rains had flooded the country in every direction; a few stone buildings, half
farm, half fortress, rose like islands out of the water; thick woods concealed
the villages on the neighbouring hills, whither for centuries the inhabitants of
the Maremma have betaken themselves at night to avoid sleeping on the fever-stricken
plain. After a few hours’ hard work Montresor, with a detachment
of five hundred men and three field-guns, marched to attack the garrison of
Campiglia, a village ten miles off. The country was inundated for three
miles, but</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“the hedges and trees on either side of the road being their guide the
British waded through, though the buffalos attached to their guns had
twice knocked up. On approaching the town the Lieutenant-Colonel sent
his light company under Captain Dunlop by another road to cut off the
enemy’s picquets from the town, and to enter it by the Leghorn road,
both of which were executed; after exchanging a few shots with the
enemy’s outposts, finding the British in their rear, they were compelled to
disperse in the woods, which left the town open to complete surprise,
inasmuch, that in front of his advance guard, at one o’clock after midnight,
Lieut.-Colonel Montresor got into the town with a confidential
servant unperceived, and personally seized an orderly French dragoon
going with despatches to the garrison of Castiglione from the Commandant
of Campiglia to announce the British having landed at
Piombino: the entrance to the town was conducted with so much
silence and arrangement that the Royal Irish Grenadiers reached the
French main guard just as the enemy were turning out under arms,
and rushing on them compelled them to lay down their arms, while
the Commandant, (whose quarters were over the main guard), escaped
by dropping out of his window over the town walls, leaving his supper,
(which he had deferred to this late hour) on the table, and which was
finished by the British officers when the prisoners were secured and the
British patrols and picquets had been placed.</p>

<p>“Colonel Wemyss having proceeded to attack Castiglione, Lieut.-Colonel
Montresor secured his post so effectually that during three
months the strong garrison of Leghorn never molested them. This
little expedition being effectually accomplished, and the troops of Elba
having formed their depôts, the British force was ordered back to
Elba.”</p></div>

<p>Much had happened while the Royal Irish were on the mainland of Italy.
In November the fleet had been obliged to go to Gibraltar for stores, and at
the end of the year Nelson had reappeared at Elba with orders from the
Admiral, Sir John Jervis (afterwards Lord St Vincent), to embark the naval
establishment and rejoin him in the Straits of Gibraltar. Nelson, however,
brought no instructions for de Burgh, and when he suggested that as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Navy had abandoned the Mediterranean it was useless for the troops to remain
in Elba, the brave old general, though much perplexed at the situation, decided
not to quit his post without orders from his military superiors. Nelson therefore
had no option but to abandon de Burgh and his three thousand troops to
their fate, and leaving transports enough for the whole of the garrison, and a
few vessels with which to keep up communication with the mainland, he
rejoined Jervis early in February, 1797. But neither Jervis nor Nelson forgot
that a detachment of the British army was marooned in a little island off the
coast of Tuscany in imminent danger of capture by the French, and soon after
the great naval victory of Cape St Vincent, Nelson dashed back into the
Mediterranean, ascertained that de Burgh and his troops were safe, and
convoyed them safely to Gibraltar. The Royal Irish landed at the end of
April or the beginning of May,<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> and formed part of the garrison of the Rock
until, two years later, they again were embarked for active service.</p>

<p>Though the failure of the expedition to Holland in the winter of 1799 had
added one more to the list of our unsuccessful enterprises against the French
on the continent of Europe, the spring of 1800 found preparations on foot in
England for another effort on land against the Republic. Lieutenant-General
Sir Ralph Abercromby, with twenty thousand men, was to disembark on the
coast of Italy near Genoa, occupy the maritime Alps, and by cutting the lines
of communication between Italy and France relieve the pressure on the
Austrians, who faced the French on the plains of Lombardy. Owing, however,
to the fear of a Franco-Spanish invasion of Portugal and the consequent
loss of the Tagus as a friendly port, a large proportion of Abercromby’s force
was kept back to defend Lisbon in case of need, and when Sir Ralph reached
Port Mahon, the capital of Minorca, which since its recapture in 1798 had
become our advanced post in the Mediterranean, he had only six thousand
men available for active operations. He found despatches awaiting him from
General Melas, the Austrian Commander-in-Chief in Italy, begging that
British troops might be sent to Genoa, which, after a heroic defence by the
French under Massena, had recently surrendered to the Austrians. Melas
himself was unable to garrison it adequately: would Abercromby therefore
do so? Ordering four thousand men, among whom were the XVIIIth Royal
Irish, 571 strong, to follow him, Abercromby sailed at once, but on the voyage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
learned that at Marengo Napoleon had defeated the Austrians, who were retreating
all along their line, and had evacuated Genoa. After definitely ascertaining
that co-operation with Melas had become impossible, he returned to Minorca,
where for many weeks the expedition awaited fresh orders from home.
During the halt Abercromby, with the help of Moore who commanded one
of his brigades, devoted himself to the improvement of the troops. He
strengthened their discipline, made their equipment suitable for active
service, and cut down the personal baggage of officers and men to the
articles absolutely necessary for a campaign. While he was at Minorca
reinforcements gradually reached him, including a body of three thousand
eight hundred men who had been on the point of attacking Belle Isle, off
the western coast of France, when they were hurriedly diverted to the
Mediterranean. Thus, when at the end of August instructions reached him
to make a raid against the Spanish port of Cadiz, Abercromby, after providing
an adequate garrison for Minorca, was able to embark between ten
and eleven thousand men.</p>

<p>A fortnight was spent on the voyage to Gibraltar, where on September
19, he was joined by a large number of troops under Lieutenant-General
Sir James Pulteney, the Colonel of the Royal Irish regiment.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Pulteney had
been sent from England to destroy Ferrol, a naval station on the north-west
coast of Spain. He had landed, driven the Spaniards back to the
shelter of their works, and then discovered that the Government had sent
him on a fool’s errand. Ferrol was well armed and fortified, and as he was
not nearly strong enough to attack it, he wisely abandoned the enterprise,
re-embarked his men, and made sail for the Rock of Gibraltar.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Thanks
to Pulteney’s arrival, Abercromby’s command now consisted of about
twenty thousand infantry and a thousand cavalry and artillerymen, and
in a few days a fleet of a hundred and thirty British men-of-war and
troop-ships appeared before Cadiz, the most important naval harbour in
the south of Spain. In the conduct of this expedition the General had by
no means a free hand, for the Ministry, while ordering him to attack Cadiz,
seize the arsenal, and destroy its docks and shipping, emphatically enjoined
upon him not to run much risk, and not to land his troops unless he was
confident that he could re-embark them safely. Operations conducted on
such lines were doomed to failure. After much discussion with the naval
authorities, a few thousand troops, including the XVIIIth, were crowded into
boats and started for the shore, only to be recalled in a few minutes to
their respective vessels, for the Admiral finally declined to guarantee their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
safe return to the ships if once they landed. After a fruitless paper
war between Abercromby and his naval colleague the whole fleet made sail,
successful only in having covered itself with ridicule. In a few hours a
great storm arose: the ships were driven in every direction along the coast
of Morocco, where for many days they tossed and rolled in a tempestuous
sea until the weather moderated and they reached Gibraltar.</p>

<p>During this storm, and indeed during the whole of the many months that
Abercromby’s command spent on board ship, the sufferings of the troops were
great. The transports were so leaky that when it rained the men were
constantly wet; so crowded that there was often not room on the decks for
all to lie down at the same time; so ill-provided that the soldiers had no
bedding, no covering other than their regimental blankets if, indeed, they
were lucky enough to possess such articles. The food was not only indifferent,
but inadequate, for an idea prevailed that the ration issued on
shore was enough for a man who was taking hard exercise, and therefore
on board ship, where the soldier theoretically was a passenger with nothing
to do, he required less to eat than on land. In practice the soldier on board a
transport had to work as hard as a sailor, and consequently was underfed.
His diet of salt pork and biscuit, his ration of water, often scanty and
generally tasting strongly of the barrels in which it was stored, and the
absence of vegetables all combined to reduce his strength, and he often fell
a prey to the scurvy which in those days devastated the fleet.</p>

<p>While the soldiers were still in the Straits of Gibraltar, where, as a sea-sick
officer wrote, “the tossing of the ship rendered our situation as landsmen at
once inconvenient and ridiculous,” Abercromby received despatches of great
importance. Dundas, the War Minister of England, had become inspired with
a great idea&mdash;to abandon the “policy of pin-pricks” by which the conduct of
our campaigns in Europe had been hitherto regulated, and strike a blow
in defence of the Empire as a whole. The year after we had abandoned Elba
Napoleon had embarked in the south of France with forty thousand men,
and after seizing Malta made himself master of Egypt and sent emissaries to
India, whose intrigues among the native princes complicated our situation in
the East.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> When he returned to France in 1799 he left behind him an army of
occupation, whose presence was a continual danger to our power in Hindustan.
This army Dundas determined to drive out, and with the reluctant
assent of the other members of the Cabinet he now ordered Abercromby to
prepare for a campaign in Lower Egypt, while a column, formed of a regiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
from Cape Colony<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> and of British and native troops from India, was to land
at Kosseir on the Red Sea, strike across the desert to Upper Egypt, descend
the Nile, and fall upon the enemy from the rear.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>The surrender of the French garrison in Malta on September 5, 1800,
placed the island at our disposal, and this, our latest conquest, was fixed as the
rendezvous of the fleet, which arrived there in detachments from Gibraltar
throughout November. While his troops rested the General strove, though
with poor results, to supplement the scanty information about the topography
and resources of Egypt vouchsafed to him by Dundas, who had provided him
with nothing but an indifferent map of the country and copies of correspondence
of doubtful value, intercepted between the French generals at Cairo and
their official superiors in Paris. Abercromby, however, learned enough to
convince him that without plenty of small craft of light draught he could not
land anywhere in Egypt, and on the 20th of December he weighed anchor for
the Bay of Marmorice&mdash;a deep inlet on the coast of Caramania, one of the
provinces of Asia Minor belonging to the Sultan, who was co-operating with
England in the Egyptian expedition. Here the General expected to obtain
shipping, and the horses with which his cavalry and artillery were still
unprovided, but when after a tempestuous voyage he reached his destination
on January 2, 1801, he found the Turkish officials so dilatory that he was
forced to spend six weeks at Marmorice. Never was time more usefully
employed, however, than during this long halt. The troops landed, drilled,
collected a great store of firewood for use in Egypt, and prepared gabions and
fascines for siege operations. The ships’ carpenters were occupied in making
small water-kegs and canteens, and light wooden sleighs to be drawn by hand
across the desert. Both services were constantly practised in the art of
disembarkation, and before the fleet again put to sea the soldiers could swarm
down the sides of the transports and take their places in the boats without
confusion; while the sailors who rowed the flotilla had learned to keep station
and to reach the shore in the prescribed order.</p>

<p>In conceiving the idea of the expedition to Egypt Dundas apparently
thought he had done all that could be expected from him, and took no trouble
about details. He failed to comply with Abercromby’s requisitions for stores
and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matériel</i>. He did not even send him the bullion for which Sir Ralph frequently
petitioned, and left him so short of actual cash that for three months
the army was unpaid, and the only way by which cavalry horses could be
bought at Marmorice was with specie produced by well-to-do officers. It is
not surprising, therefore, that Abercromby wrote, “We are now on the point
of sailing for the coast of Egypt with very slender means for executing the
orders we have received. I never went on any service entertaining greater
doubt of success, at the same time with more determination to encounter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
difficulties.... The Dutch expedition was walking on velvet compared to
this.”<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> On February 22, he put to sea, and after a stormy passage of eight
days reached Aboukir Bay&mdash;a wide indentation on the western coast of the
delta of the Nile, where in August, 1798, Nelson had destroyed the fleet which
had convoyed Napoleon’s army to Egypt. Though for several days the waves
were too high to admit of disembarkation, small ships were able to reconnoitre
the coast closely, and their reports determined Abercromby to land on a
narrow promontory which, running north-east from Alexandria for eight or
nine miles, separates the waters of the Mediterranean from those of Lake
Aboukir, or Lake Madie as it is sometimes called.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>Sir Ralph’s effective strength consisted of about 16,000 men,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> including
the live hundred cavalry for whom horses had been obtained, and the gunners
with sixteen field-pieces. The infantry were formed into six brigades and a
reserve; the latter, a unit double the strength of any of the other brigades,
was commanded by Major-General (afterwards Sir John) Moore. The
XVIIIth doubtless wished to serve under the orders of Moore, whose worth
they had learned at Calvi, but, with the 8th, 13th, and 90th regiments, found
themselves under Major-General Cradock, whose brigade (the second) was
composed of battalions of very unequal strength; the 90th had 850 officers
and men; the 13th were weaker by a hundred; the 8th had 538 of all ranks,
while the roll of the XVIIIth only bore 523 names.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Not all the men in
Abercromby’s little army were British born. About 2700 were foreigners:
Stuart’s Minorca regiment was a collection of ne’er-do-weels from every
country in Europe; De Roll’s was composed of Swiss; Dillon’s of French
Royalists; Hompesch’s dragoons were Germans, while the Corsican Rangers
probably contained some of the men first raised and disciplined by Montresor
of the XVIIIth. To meet this expedition Menou, the French Commander-in-Chief,
had under his orders about 21,500 combatants; his cavalry was superb;
he possessed sixty-six field-guns; many of his infantry were veterans
whom Napoleon had led from victory to victory in the plains of Lombardy.
Eleven thousand troops were concentrated at Cairo, 6000 were allotted to the
defence of Alexandria and of the coast from that city to Rosetta; 1800 held
the country round Damietta; 1000 were absorbed by the garrisons of
Suez, Balbeis, and Salalieh; the remainder were stationed in Upper Egypt.
The news of Abercromby’s appearance off the Delta reached Cairo about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
same time as a report that a Turkish force was advancing slowly through
Syria upon Egypt. Menou, puzzled by the situation, frittered away his
strength by sending detachments to unimportant points; he did not at once
reinforce Alexandria, and thus when Abercromby disembarked he was met
by only two thousand men with fifteen pieces of field artillery.</p>

<p>Until March 7, no landing was possible, but then the weather moderated,
and at 2 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span> on the 8th, a rocket from the Admiral’s ship gave the signal to
put into execution the scheme which had been repeatedly explained to the
officers of both services. The boats were to form up in three lines at a place
of assembly, marked by three small craft anchored out of gun-shot from the
shore. The first line consisted of large flat-bottom row-boats, each containing
fifty soldiers, and of launches carrying field-guns ready for instant use: these
boats and launches were to be fifty feet apart, and to keep “interval” and
“dressing” accurately. In second line were ships’ boats, to help the first
line in case of need. Behind them followed the third line&mdash;cutters towing
launches, full of men of the same regiment as that directly in front of them.
These supporting troops were to land in the fifty-feet interval between the
boats of the first line. The Reserve, the brigade of Guards, and part of the
first brigade were the units named in orders to lead the way, and by 3.30 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span>
they were in the boats; but owing to the extreme shallowness of the water
many of the transports were anchored so far from the shore that it was not
until 9 o’clock that the last of the troops had reached the rendezvous. Then
on the signal of the naval captain in charge the sailors gave way, and in
silence, only broken by the regular dip of hundreds of oars into the water,
rowed steadily towards the yellow sandhills where the soldiers were to land.
Until the first line was well within their range, the French gave no sign of
life; then they poured a perfect hurricane of round-shot, grape, and musketry
upon the leading boats, several of which were sunk. As soon as the first shot
came whistling round their ears, the sailors rowed harder than ever; the
soldiers, packed like herrings in a tub, could do nothing but cheer until the
bluejackets ran into shallow water, when their turn came; springing overboard,
they waded to the shore and fought hand to hand with the French,
who lunged fiercely at them with their bayonets as they struggled up the
slippery beach. After a short but sharp engagement the French fell back,
but not until they had inflicted upon us a loss heavy in comparison to the
number of men actually engaged. Among the sailors there were ninety-seven
casualties; of the soldiers a hundred and two were killed, five hundred
and fifteen wounded, and thirty-five missing, or a total in the two services of
seven hundred and forty-nine. The Royal Irish and the remainder of the
second brigade had been transferred to small Greek ships of light draft,
which moved close inshore to support the advance-guard, but before Cradock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
could land his troops, the French were in retreat, and thus on this memorable
day the XVIIIth did not come into action.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>Thanks to the success of this thoughtfully planned, carefully rehearsed,
and brilliantly executed stroke, the remainder of the troops disembarked
without difficulty, and began to move towards Alexandria. Their progress,
however, was very slow, for Abercromby was crippled by want of land
transport, and until, by a second victory, he could win the Egyptians to his
side and obtain from them camels and oxen, he was forced to rely for his
supplies on the service of small craft by which the Navy landed food and
stores on the shores of Lake Aboukir, where his left flank rested. The army
halted on the 12th in front of a line of sandhills strongly held by the enemy,
against whose possible night attack were taken the precautions thus described
in Moore’s diary: “The 90th and 92nd were put under my command.
I divided these two regiments each into three bodies, separated at
such distances as to cover the front of the army, and I ordered each body to
throw forward one-third of their numbers, with the officers belonging to it,
as sentries in front. This formed a strong chain, which was relieved every
hour by one of the thirds in reserve. The enemy was so close to us that it
was evident that neither army could move without bringing on an action.”
From this position Abercromby determined to drive the French by a frontal
attack combined with a turning movement on their right; and early on the
13th he moved from his bivouac in three huge columns, with the 90th regiment
covering the front as advance-guard. The undulations of the ground
hid the centre column from the French General, who, thinking that our right
and left columns were too far apart to be able to support each other, determined
to crush them in detail, and covering his advance by a vigorous and
well-aimed artillery fire descended into the plain. Cradock’s brigade deployed
into line “with great quickness and precision,” and pressed on to
meet the foe, whose cavalry, after a fruitless attack upon the advance-guard,
charged the main body with great determination, but were so hotly received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
with well-aimed musketry that they were driven back in confusion. Of the
part played by the XVIIIth in this episode the regimental record of service
contains a spirited, though somewhat breathless description.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A strong body of cavalry having meanwhile charged the two regiments
supporting the left of the front line, but being repulsed, rode in
towards the 2nd brigade under cover of some sand hills; and observing
an interval between our regiment and that on its left, immediately
advanced to charge through it, in which they must have succeeded had
they not been checked by a prompt and well-directed fire from our Light
company, for, unfortunately, the left battalion of the brigade having
mistaken them, from their green uniforms for Hompesch’s Hussars
(attached to our army) not only suffered them to ride quietly along their
front, but kept calling out to us not to fire upon them; this error having,
however, been fortunately discovered when the cavalry were within a
hundred paces of us, and in the act of wheeling up to charge, the regiment
halted, and opening a steady and rapid platoon fire immediately
after that of the Light company, brought down a great number of men
and horses, threw them into complete disorder and compelled them to a
precipitate retreat, though many of them had even arrived within a few
paces of the interval on our left. Had not the Royal Irish so timely
opened its fire, the brigade must have been broken through, and the
enemy penetrated to the second line, which in firing on them must at the
same time have fired upon us. This cavalry, by a strange coincidence,
happened to be the 18th regiment of heavy dragoons, and afterwards
(when a troop of this corps was taken in the desert) they said, pointing
to us, ‘had it not been for that regiment it was all over with your
expedition.’”</p></div>

<p>The action raged along nearly the whole line till the French, staggered by
the warmth of their reception and overborne by superior numbers, gave way,
and retired to the works of Nicopolis, where a series of redoubts stretching
across the peninsula barred the way to Alexandria. The enemy covered his
retreat with sharpshooters, supported by artillery so mobile and so well-handled
that the British were filled with admiration, contrasting its quick
movements to those of our field-guns which, from want of horses, had to be
dragged laboriously by hand. Abercromby hoped to carry the lines of
Nicopolis with a rush, and followed the French across the plain between
their first and second positions until he had to halt to make dispositions for
the assault. For several hours the troops remained stationary under a
murderous fire from the enemy’s batteries, waiting to be let loose upon the
French; but when a careful reconnaissance had convinced Abercromby that
the second position was too strong to be carried until its defenders had been
shaken by a heavy bombardment, he reluctantly ordered his little army to
retire, and in perfect order it marched back to the ground from which the
enemy had been driven in the morning, and settled down into bivouac. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
General was not unmindful of the good work done by Cradock’s command;
in a general order thanking the troops for “their soldier-like and intrepid
conduct, he felt it incumbent on him particularly to express his most perfect
satisfaction with the steady and gallant conduct of Major-General Cradock’s
brigade;” and in his despatch to the Secretary of State for War, when describing
the events of the early part of the battle, he stated: “Major-General
Cradock immediately formed his brigade to meet the attack made by
the enemy; and the troops<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> changed their position with a quickness and
precision which did them the greatest honour. The remainder of the army
followed so good an example, and immediately were in a situation not only
to face but to repel the enemy.”</p>

<p>This action cost the lives of six officers and a hundred and fifty of the
other ranks; sixty-seven officers and a thousand and two non-commissioned
officers and men were wounded; the sailors and marines together lost eighty-four
of all ranks; thus the casualties in both services amounted to thirteen
hundred and nine killed and wounded. Though the regiments under
Cradock’s command suffered more than those in the other brigades, losing
upwards of five hundred officers and men, the XVIIIth escaped comparatively
lightly. Captain George Jones was killed, and three officers, whose names
are not mentioned in the despatch, were wounded; among the other ranks a
sergeant and forty-five rank and file were wounded.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> The French did not
lose as heavily as we did&mdash;not more than five hundred of their troops were
put out of action; but they left in our hands four guns and a large quantity
of ammunition.</p>

<p>The position that Abercromby now held was about a mile and a half long,
stretching from the Mediterranean on the right to Lake Aboukir on the left.
In front of the right and centre rose a chain of sandhills; on the left the ground
was level. While the heavy artillery and ordnance stores were being slowly
moved over the nine miles of sandy track between Aboukir Bay and the
bivouac, the General entrenched himself, posting Cradock’s brigade on the
extreme left of the front line. On the 19th the big guns began to arrive,
accompanied by a recently landed detachment of Turks, of such doubtful
military value that they were ordered to halt three miles in rear of the British
troops. Next day a friendly Arab chief sent word that Alexandria had been
largely reinforced, thus confirming the reports from the men on outpost who,
through the mists of early morning, had seen long strings of camels moving
towards the town. The Arab added that the French proposed to attack us
at dawn on the 21st. Though not fully convinced of the truth of this intelligence,
Abercromby pressed on his field-works and ordered his troops to stand
to arms before dawn&mdash;a wise precaution, for the Arab’s information proved
correct. Menou had accompanied the reinforcements, and after providing an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
adequate garrison for Alexandria, could dispose of 10,000 men with whom he
proposed to surprise the English before daybreak. A feint was to be made
against our left, our centre was to be vigorously engaged, while the full force
of the attack was to fall upon the right. As soon as it was crumpled up a
general movement along the line was to drive us into the waters of the lake,
where we should have to surrender or to drown.</p>

<p>While it was still black night on the 21st, the French began the action by
demonstrating against our left, and though the false attack was not pressed
home, it was successful in so far that troops, urgently required on other parts
of the field, were diverted to the help of Cradock’s brigade. In the centre the
enemy made no headway against the steady volleys of the regiments facing him;
the danger was in his onslaught on our right, where for a long time there
raged a series of fierce and confused fights. The piquets were driven in, and
the supports surprised by columns suddenly looming out of the murky darkness;
reinforcements on either side hurried up, guided by the flash of the
muskets and the shouts of the combatants&mdash;prisoners and Colours were taken
and recaptured, posts lost and regained. At one moment the French slipped
unperceived between two corps, which in the very nick of time discovered and
routed them with the bayonet: a little later a regiment, while hotly engaged
in front, was surrounded by a body of the enemy whose presence was revealed
by the sound of a French word of command. The rear rank turned
about, and fighting back to back, drove off their foes. Episodes such as these
marked the progress of the action until the morning light showed Menou that
all his efforts had been unavailing, and that the British line, shattered but
unconquered, still held its ground. Mad with rage at his want of success the
French General, against the advice of his subordinates, hurled his cavalry,
1200 strong, into the fray. They crashed through a regiment whose formation
they broke, though not its spirit, and swept like a torrent over the battlefield
until they reached the camp, where the horses stumbled over the tent-ropes
and fell into the burrows, scratched in the sand as sleeping places by a
corps whose tents had not arrived. The confusion thus caused was increased
by the cross-fire of the infantry who had been left in charge of the baggage,
and the French cavalry wheeled about and retired at full speed, leaving the
ground behind them covered with their dead. After several more desperate
efforts, in which assailants and assailed displayed equal courage, Menou realised
that he was defeated, and fell back slowly and in good order. His solid
columns offered a splendid target to our artillerymen; but the guns were
silent, to the intense surprise of the French who expected to be pursued by a
hail of projectiles, and to the mortification of the British infantry, who looked
to the gunners to avenge their losses. But the gunners could not fire; they
were as short of ammunition as the foot soldiers themselves, many of whom
had been forced to rely exclusively on their bayonets in the later phases of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the battle. It was not that ammunition was lacking in the camp, but owing
to a staff blunder there was no means of getting it up to the fighting line.
Had our gunners been able to do their duty the French loss would have been
enormous, but they escaped with 2000 casualties.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> On our side the gallant
Abercromby was mortally wounded; and of the 11,500 men engaged, 10
officers and 233 other ranks were killed; 60 officers and 1133 other ranks
wounded; 3 officers and 29 men missing. The Royal Irish, who were on the
left flank of Cradock’s brigade, and therefore far away from the scene of
the serious fighting, were almost untouched, only two private soldiers being
wounded.</p>

<p>Some days were spent in the work of reorganisation. Stores and ammunition
had to be brought up from Aboukir, and arrangements made with
the natives for the hire of transport of various kinds. Before the army was
ready to move Sir Ralph Abercromby died, deeply regretted by all who had
been privileged to serve under him. He was succeeded by a future Colonel
of the XVIIIth, Major-General the Hon. John Hely-Hutchinson,<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> who decided to
leave Major-General Coote to invest Alexandria with 6000 men, while he himself
led the main column to Cairo. As a first step he sent a mixed force of British
and Turks across the desert to seize Rosetta, a town important from its position
at the mouth of the western branch of the Nile, and a few days later reinforced
it with the XVIIIth and the 90th regiments. Rosetta was occupied
without trouble; our gunboats entered the Nile; a large amount of river
craft was collected, and on May 4, 9500 British and Turkish troops began to
move upon Cairo.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> The march proved a very trying one, for the heat was
great, the climate exhausting, and as there were no roads and practically no
land transport, the army had to depend for its supplies on the flotilla of boats
which accompanied its progress towards the capital of Egypt. Sending a
strong detachment to the right bank of the river to connect him with the
Turkish contingent from Syria, Hely-Hutchinson worked up the left bank
with the main body, gradually capturing or driving away the garrisons of
the fortified posts along the Nile. In these small affairs the Royal Irish had
no opportunity of distinguishing themselves.</p>

<p>After joining forces with the Turks, the General pushed on towards Cairo,
and halting on the 16th of June within a few miles of the city, found the
French much more disposed to treat for surrender than to fight. The perimeter
of the crumbling fortifications was far too large to be adequately defended
by the 9000 effective men to whom the garrison was reduced; outside
the walls was encamped an Anglo-Turkish army of 30,000 men, and Baird’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
contingent from India and the Cape might any day bring an important accession
to its strength; the civil population was disaffected; the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">morale</i> of the
soldiers was shaken by the events of the campaign; all ranks were anxious
to return to France, and it was well known that the English were prepared
to give them very favourable terms. In such circumstances negotiations
proved swift and easy, and on June 27 a convention was signed, by which
Hely-Hutchinson undertook to escort the French garrison with its baggage,
field-guns and ammunition to Rosetta, and there embark it for the French
ports on the Mediterranean. The march from Cairo to the sea, organised and
commanded by Moore, was a very delicate operation, brilliantly carried out.
It began on July 15: the Turks led the column; then, after a long interval,
followed the French infantry and guns, their cavalry abreast of them,
but on the left flank, farthest from the river; some distance behind came the
British column, with a detachment of dragoons and Turkish cavalry bringing
up the rear. Three hundred river craft, filled with sick and baggage, slowly
dropped down the Nile under the escort of our gunboats, and kept up
constant communication between the French and English columns. The
embarkation was completed on the 7th of August, when 13,672 soldiers and 82
civilians sailed for France, in transports convoyed by British men-of-war.
Everything passed off smoothly, but of all the British officers at Rosetta none
can have been more heartily thankful when the last of our enemies was safely
on board ship than Colonel Montresor, who, as governor, was responsible for
the safety of the persons and the property of the inhabitants while the French
troops were marching through the town.</p>

<p>Hely-Hutchinson now turned his attention to Alexandria, which he had
left invested by General Coote when the main body advanced upon Cairo.
Thanks to the arrival of large reinforcements from England, he was now able
to besiege it in due form, and pushed on his works so fast that on the 31st of
August the garrison, 10,528 strong, surrendered on terms identical with
those granted at Cairo. The Royal Irish were present at the operations, and
with other picked troops their grenadier company, with drums beating and
Colours flying, marched into Alexandria to take formal possession of the
town. Their triumphal entry marked the end of the Egyptian campaign,
in which 500 officers and men were killed and 3058 were wounded: how
many died from sickness is not known, but the mortality must have been
considerable. In the regiment Captain-Lieutenant G. Jones was killed, and
Captain W. Morgue, Ensign H. Bruley, Ensign W. Brand, Quartermaster
M. M‘Dermott, and fifty-six of the other ranks died from wounds, accident, or
disease.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> During the summer the Royal Irish suffered much from sickness,
and in the month of July more than two hundred men were in hospital,
chiefly from ophthalmia, which was then raging among the troops.</p>

<p>The thanks of Parliament were voted to both services; the XVIIIth Royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Irish were authorised to carry on the Colours the emblem of a Sphinx and the
word “Egypt,” and gold medals were presented by the Sultan to all the
officers of the regiment. It was not until the year 1847 that a British medal
was issued for this campaign, when only three officers&mdash;Hill, Beavan, and
Deane&mdash;were still alive to claim the decoration.</p>

<p>As soon as the last of the French were shipped off to France, Hely-Hutchinson’s
army was broken up. Some of the troops remained to share
with Baird’s contingent the duty of holding Egypt for a few months; the
remainder returned to various parts of the Mediterranean to await the results
of the negotiations for peace then going on between the Governments of
England and France. The Royal Irish were sent first to Malta, and then on
to Elba, where Montresor was appointed military governor of Porto Ferraio
for the second time: and when peace was declared the regiment was ordered
home, and landed at Cork at the end of August, 1802.</p>

<p>Though there were many signs that France looked upon the Peace of
Amiens more as a truce than as the end of her struggle with Britain, our
Government soon began to cut down all military expenditure with unreasoning
haste. Wholesale discharges from the army left only 40,000 regular
troops in the United Kingdom; the militia, after an embodiment of nine
years, were sent to their homes; the “fencible” regiments of horse and foot,
raised for purposes of local defence, were disbanded. Thus the renewal of
the war in 1803 found us almost disarmed; and when Napoleon collected an
army for the invasion of England the Government was hard pressed to raise a
garrison sufficient for the needs of the United Kingdom. By paying huge
bounties to recruits the numbers of the regular army were increased to 12,000
cavalry and 75,000 infantry; bounties nearly as large attracted 80,000 men to
the militia; while to escape a mitigated form of compulsory service, introduced
to catch those who would not serve of their own free will, 343,000 men joined
corps of Yeomanry or regiments of Volunteers. How far this mass of armed
men would have been able to face veterans who had won innumerable victories
in western and central Europe is a matter of speculation. Happily for England
at the beginning of the nineteenth century, though perhaps unhappily
for the British Empire of the present day, the threatened invasion did not
take place, and our race had no opportunity to ascertain by practical experience
whether Britons, very imperfectly trained to war, are as good
fighting men as foreigners who have thoroughly mastered the soldier’s trade
before they meet their enemy on the battlefield.</p>

<p>Among the steps taken to increase the regular army was the formation of
additional battalions of infantry, one or two of which were allotted to existing
regiments. The second battalion of the XVIIIth was raised in Ireland in
1803, and, like the first, served in Scotland until the summer of 1804, when
both were sent to Barham Downs, one of the many camps in the south of
England where large numbers of troops stood ready to march towards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
coast. After a few months the first battalion was ordered to the West Indies,
and sailing in January, 1805, with other corps, reached Jamaica at the end of
April, 935 strong.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> The second battalion remained at Barham Downs until
the destruction of the Franco-Spanish fleet at Trafalgar put an end to
Napoleon’s hope of obtaining the temporary command of the Channel necessary
to pass his troops across the Straits of Dover. As soon as all danger of
invasion was over the encampment was broken up, and the second battalion
was sent to garrison Jersey.</p>

<p>When the first battalion of the Royal Irish landed at Kingston, the island
was in a fever of anxiety, for the attitude of the black population, who had
been thoroughly unsettled by the French Revolution, was disquieting not only
in Jamaica but throughout the British West Indies; the coasts were infested
by privateers who captured many trading ships; and a great fleet of the
enemy’s men-of-war was reported to be cruising among the neighbouring
islands. These French ships, however, were part of the squadrons sent by
Napoleon to decoy Nelson and his brother admirals from their blockade of the
seaports on the Mediterranean and the Bay of Biscay: their business was to
evade the British fleet, to return to Europe, and joining forces with the
remainder of the Franco-Spanish fleet, to sweep all British men-of-war from
the Channel before our admirals had discovered that they had quitted the
West Indies. Thus Jamaica was not attacked; in a few months the excitement
died down, and the Royal Irish fell into the routine of the station where
they were destined to spend twelve long and dreary years. Once there seemed
a prospect of active service: in 1809 they were ordered to form part of an
expedition to the island of San Domingo,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> where the Spaniards, who had
again become our allies, were waging war against the French garrison.
Major-General Sir Hugh Carmichael sailed from Jamaica on the 7th of June,
and landed three weeks later at Polingue, a port thirty miles from the city of
San Domingo, where the Spaniards were besieging the common enemy. As
soon as his troops were safe on shore the General hurried up to the front, and
after a reconnaissance decided that, as the French had already held out for
eight months, the best way to deal with them would be by a sudden and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
vigorous attack. At nightfall on the 1st of July his men struggled up from
the coast, tired out by heavy marches in pouring rain, over bad roads, through
unbridged rivers, and without horses for the guns, which had to be dragged
by hand. Next day the French opened negotiations for surrender, but asked
for such impossible terms that Carmichael made his plans to storm the works,
and allotted to the Royal Irish an important part in the operations; but before
the assault could be delivered the garrison of the town capitulated. As the
tricolor still flew over an outlying fort, Major E. Walker, XVIIIth regiment,
was sent to reduce it with the Light companies of his own and two other
battalions: but on the approach of the little column, the officer in command
laid down his arms, and with the lowering of his flag passed away the last
chance of the Royal Irish of distinguishing themselves in the second phase
of the great war with France. The terms of the capitulation were much the
same as those granted in Corsica and Egypt: the French were to be sent back
to their own country, and after the Royal Irish had seen their enemies safely
embarked for France, they returned to Jamaica. At the taking of San Domingo
none of the British were injured, while few if any died of sickness in the
island. In this respect they were infinitely more fortunate than the troops
who served in the campaign in San Domingo between 1793 and 1795, when in
a few weeks whole regiments were virtually annihilated by yellow fever,
which in those three years claimed 40,000 victims from the army and the fleet
in West Indian waters.</p>

<p>As the news of Wellington’s successive victories in the Peninsula slowly
made its way to Jamaica the hearts of the Royal Irish must have sunk very
low, when they realised that they were stationed in a part of the world where
there was no prospect of adding to the laurels of the regiment. Yet their lot
was common to the greater part of the British army, scattered over the whole
face of the globe, in places where the prospect of active service seemed most
improbable. In 1809, England had about 218,000 regular soldiers, of whom
only 22,000 were fighting in the Peninsula. A hundred and eight thousand
were locked up in the United Kingdom, to give solidity to the 450,000 Militia
and Volunteers then under arms; the Mediterranean fortresses and Sicily
absorbed 22,000; the West Indies nearly as many; 8000 guarded the Canadian
frontier; the communication with the East was kept open by 900 at Madeira,
and nearly 6000 at the Cape; 4000 held the Island of Ceylon; in India were
24,000 white troops, of whom only 4000 were in the pay of the East India
Company, while 1300 were employed in keeping order in the penal settlement
of New South Wales. The corps of artillery and engineers and troops at sea
accounted for the remainder of the army.</p>

<p>The second battalion was no more fortunate than the first, for in 1807
it was ordered to a recently acquired British possession in the West Indies,
the island of Curaçoa. In December, 1806, a gallant sailor, Captain Sir
Charles Brisbane, was ordered to reconnoitre the island, then belonging to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Holland; converting his reconnaissance into an attack, he led his four frigates
into the harbour, and boarded two Dutch men-of-war lying at anchor; then
sending landing parties on shore he captured the forts, and made himself
master of Curaçoa. The battalion arrived in June, 726 strong,<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> and remained
stationary until 1810, when, worn down to a mere skeleton by sickness, and
by large drafts to the sister battalion in Jamaica, it was ordered home to
recruit. Beyond the fact that in 1808 the officers presented a handsome
sword of honour to Brisbane, whom they found installed at Curaçoa as
Governor, nothing is known of the doings of the second battalion during
its short existence, which ended in 1814, when, like nearly all the other second
battalions of the army, it was disbanded. The story of its resuscitation will
be found in <a href="#CHAPTER_IX">Chapter IX</a>.</p>

<p>Though neither battalion was on active service in the West Indies, for
the expedition to San Domingo cannot be counted as a campaign, the regiment
was exposed during this tour of duty in the colonies to dangers greater and
far more trying than those of pitched battles. Tropical diseases played havoc
among the Royal Irish: between the arrival of the first battalion in the
middle of 1805, and its return to England in the spring of 1817, the loss of
both battalions from sickness was fifty-two officers and seventeen hundred
and seventy-seven non-commissioned officers and men.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> The heaviest
mortality appears to have occurred during the two months ending January
25, 1806, when a hundred and forty names were added to the list of dead.
Nor was disease the only peril to which the Royal Irish were exposed. While
they were stationed in Jamaica the island was scourged by earthquakes and
tidal waves, by fires that destroyed flourishing towns, by floods that laid
waste great tracts of cultivated land. There were mutinies among the
regiments raised from the slaves; conspiracies among the negroes to murder
the white men, and widespread disaffection and unrest throughout all the
coloured population. After such grim experiences of West Indian life it
was with feelings of great joy that in January, 1817, the regiment bade
farewell to the land where so many hundreds of their comrades had
perished.</p>

<p class="noindent">The XVIIIth Royal Irish regiment landed at Portsmouth in March, 1817.
Since 1783, the Royal Irish had only served three years in the United
Kingdom, and they looked forward to a long tour of duty at home, but
the fates were against them. Almost as soon as Napoleon surrendered
himself to the captain of the <i>Bellerophon</i> the economists in the House of
Commons began to demand retrenchment in the army, and with such success
that in 1821 only 101,000 men, exclusive of the troops in the East India
Company’s service, were left to protect the whole of the British possessions
throughout the world. The garrison of the United Kingdom absorbed about
half the army, the remainder being stationed in India and the colonies,
where, it is said, Wellington hid them to be out of sight of the anti-military
politicians. Among the regiments ordered abroad was the XVIIIth, which
in February, 1821, left Cork for the Mediterranean; it spent three years at
Malta and eight in the Ionian Isles,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> and in March, 1832, returned to England.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1832, the Royal Irish were quartered in detachments in
various towns in Lancashire and Yorkshire; during the general election at
the end of the year several companies were called upon to help the civil
power in quelling serious riots at Sheffield, Bolton, and Preston, where officers
and men won high praise for the combination of forbearance and determination
which they showed in dealing with excited mobs. Towards the end
of 1833 the regiment was concentrated at Manchester, whence on May 8,
1834, to quote the words in which the Digest of Service records the first
train journey of the XVIIIth, it “proceeded by railway conveyance” to
Liverpool to embark for Dublin. In September the regiment moved to
Cork; a few months later it was at Birr, and early in 1836, while at Athlone,
it was warned for foreign service in Ceylon. Throughout their tour of duty
in the United Kingdom the Royal Irish received warm commendation from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
all the generals under whom they had served, and these favourable opinions
were fully endorsed in a letter from the Adjutant-General, who on December
20, 1834, wrote that “the report of the XVIIIth Royal Irish regiment is
considered most satisfactory. The excellent state of its discipline is highly
creditable to Colonel Burrell, and Lord Hill cannot be but more disposed
to attachment (<em>sic</em>) to that officer’s exertions when he finds that discipline
has been so effectually maintained without having had recourse to corporal
punishment for a period exceeding two years.”</p>

<p>Two companies under Major Pratt sailed from Cork in the transport
<i>Numa</i> on November 15, 1836, and arrived at Colombo towards the end of
April, 1837. The remainder of the corps, under Colonel Burrell, embarked
in the transport <i>Barossa</i>, touched at Teneriffe and Rio de Janeiro, and reached
its destination at the end of May. After serving for some time at Colombo,
where new colours were presented by Lieutenant-General Sir John Wilson,
K.C.B., the headquarters and a wing of the regiment were stationed at
Trincomalee, where in 1840 welcome news reached them. Trouble had
arisen with China, and the regiment was to form part of an expedition
against the Celestial Empire. The causes of our quarrel with the Emperor
of China, very shortly stated, were that the Chinese had not kept to the
treaties of commerce which they had entered into with England; they had
attacked and robbed British merchants, fired upon English ships, and grossly
insulted the representative of the Queen. The Mandarins, or high officials
of Canton, were the chief offenders; to punish them a naval blockade of
that port was established; ships of war were ordered up from the Indian
station, and a small body of troops was collected to co-operate with the
Navy in bringing the Chinese to their senses. The six companies of the
Royal Irish in Ceylon sailed eastwards in May and June, 1840, and the three
depôt companies, recently landed at Bombay from England, joined headquarters
soon after the regiment arrived in China, raising it to a total strength
of 667 of all ranks.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> The other British regiments were the 26th and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
49th; the Native army of India contributed detachments of Madras Artillery
and Sappers and Miners, a corps known as the Bengal Volunteers, and the
37th regiment of Madras Native Infantry, while the Navy was represented by
three line-of-battle ships, two frigates, fourteen smaller men-of-war, four
armed steamers, and twenty-seven transports. With this small force England
was about to go to war with a country of three hundred and sixty millions
of inhabitants, whose seaport towns were defended by forts bristling with
ordnance varying in calibre from 68-pr. to 18-pr. guns, and whose army
immeasurably exceeded in number the British fighting men. Fortunately for
us the Chinese artillerymen, though not wanting in courage, were ill-trained;
their forts, though massive, were badly planned; and the infantry, though
they often fought well and showed much courage as individuals, were poorly
disciplined, badly armed, and as a rule very badly commanded. Though the
government of Pekin had spent much money in making cannon on European
models, they had neglected to reproduce the muskets with which the troops
of the white races were equipped. Thus the Chinese foot soldiers did not
possess the equivalent of our flint-lock smooth-bore muskets; their firearms
were matchlocks and gingals or portable wall pieces, worked on tripods
by a crew of three men, and throwing two-ounce balls. Their other weapons
varied; the Tartars, the picked troops of the Empire, used the bow; other
corps had spears and swords, while others again carried battle-axes and very
unpleasant cutting instruments like bill-hooks, fastened to the end of long
poles.</p>

<p>The policy and general conduct of our expedition was entrusted to two
Plenipotentiaries. One of these officials soon broke down in health and
disappeared from the scene; the other, who was credited with some knowledge
of the Chinese character, proved to be amiable and well-intentioned,
but vacillating, credulous, and incompetent to meet the wiles of Eastern
diplomacy. His gullibility and want of backbone cruelly hampered the
movements of the sailors and soldiers until, many months after the beginning
of the war, he was replaced by Sir Henry Pottinger, an Indian officer of
large experience in dealing with Oriental races.</p>

<p>After assembling at Singapore, the point fixed for the general rendezvous,
the fleet sailed for China, and, contrary to the universal expectation, did not
stop at the mouth of the Canton river, but followed the coast upwards to the
island of Chusan.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> From its position near the mouth of the Yang-Tse-Kiang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
river this island was of great strategic importance, and was required as a
base of operations. Tinghae, its principal town, was weakly held, but when
the Mandarins were summoned to surrender they replied that, though they
had no hope of making a successful resistance, they were in honour bound
to defend their post. After a short bombardment by the men-of-war on
July 5, 1840, the troops were landed, the XVIIIth leading the attack, and
the place fell into our hands. Our casualties were very few; the Chinese,
on the contrary, lost very heavily, but the climate quickly avenged them.
For several months the troops were kept inactive in Chusan, which proved
to be a hot-bed of disease. In the hope of conciliating the inhabitants the
soldiers at first were ordered to live under canvas, though there were hundreds
of houses in which they could have been quartered. The camping grounds
were selected without reference to the doctors, who protested in vain when
they saw the “tents pitched on low paddy-fields, surrounded by stagnant
water, putrid and stinking from quantities of dead animal and vegetable
matter. Under a sun hotter than was ever experienced in India,” wrote a
Madras army surgeon, “the men on duty were buckled up to the throat
in their full-dress coatees, and in consequence of there being so few camp
followers, fatigue-parties of Europeans were daily detailed to carry provisions
and stores from the ships to the tents, and to perform all menial employments,
which experience has long taught us they cannot stand in a tropical
climate.”<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> The troops were fed on rations not only unsuited to the climate
but of bad quality; much of the biscuit was bad, and the meat salted in
India proved uneatable. Small wonder that in such circumstances intermittent
fever, diarrhœa, and dysentery raged among all ranks; and though
after a time the troops were moved into the houses of the natives, disease
had taken such hold upon all ranks that in November there were not more
than five hundred effectives at Chusan. The Royal Irish fared better
than the other regiments, as the ships from which they drew most of
their supplies were laden with stores prepared not in India, but in England;
but still they suffered severely&mdash;two officers, Major R. Hammill and
Lieutenant H. F. Vavasour, and about fifty of the other ranks died between
July 5th and the end of the year.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> Yet these losses were insignificant
compared to those of the 26th, which from nine hundred was reduced
to a strength, all told, of two hundred and ninety-one.</p>

<p>In January, 1841, there were combined naval and military operations
against the forts at the mouth of the Canton river, in which the Royal Irish
took no part as they had been left to garrison Chusan; a few of the regiment,
however, were present, probably invalids serving on board ship for change of
air. After several batteries had been dismantled and many heavy guns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
spiked or otherwise disabled, the Mandarins made a treaty with the
Plenipotentiary, by which they agreed to cede to us the island of Hong
Kong, to pay a considerable indemnity, and to allow trade to be reopened
at Canton, while on our side we undertook to restore Chusan to the Chinese.
No time was lost in occupying Hong Kong, of which formal possession was
taken on February 26, 1841, two days after the Royal Irish arrived there.
Colonel Burrell, XVIIIth, had been the senior military officer throughout the
occupation of Chusan, and very thankful must he have been when, after
seeing the last of the garrison safely on board ship, he turned his back on the
island which proved fatal to such numbers of his men.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Very soon after the
expedition had been concentrated at Hong Kong it became evident that the
treaty was not worth the paper it was written upon. Far from being anxious
for peace, the Chinese had only sought to gain time to prepare for war. An
army of labourers was strengthening the defences of Canton; an army of
soldiers was being collected in the interior of China to man them; large
rewards were offered for the capture of British ships and British fighting
men; for a battleship a hundred thousand dollars were promised; the Admiral
and the Plenipotentiary were worth fifty thousand dollars each; the other
officers were rated on a descending scale, while the price of a Madras Sepoy
was only fifty dollars. On the 24th of February the fleet bombarded the
celebrated Bogue forts in the Canton river; five hundred guns were taken,
and everyone hoped that the ships would now be allowed to push up the river
and capture Canton, when all movements were temporarily arrested by the
announcement that the Plenipotentiary had entered into a truce. As, however,
the Chinese did not fulfil its terms, the men-of-war engaged, silenced and
destroyed such of the batteries as they had not yet attacked; made their
way up the reaches of the river, and anchored close to Canton. The city lay
almost defenceless under their guns, when the Plenipotentiary agreed to a
suspension of hostilities on condition that the port should be reopened to
British trade. This arrangement suited the Chinese admirably: the civil
population would be enriched by the money paid by the merchants for the tea
crop, then ready for delivery; while the military Mandarins gained time to
cast new ordnance, to rebuild their ruined forts, and to reinforce the garrison
before again defying the “Barbarians.”<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> The troops were ordered back to
the harbour of Hong Kong, where Major-General Sir Hugh Gough, who had
recently arrived from Madras to take command of the land forces, reorganised
his little army, and attempted, though with small success, to infuse his own
spirit of determination into the weak-kneed Plenipotentiary, whom Gough in
a private letter described as “whimsical as a shuttle-cock.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not long before the position of affairs at Canton once more became
most serious. The gun factories had been working night and day; the forts
had been repaired and re-armed; large numbers of soldiers had arrived; and in
May the extermination was decreed of the European merchants, who on the
faith of the truce had now returned to their counting-houses. This roused
the Plenipotentiary into temporary activity; he arranged with Gough and
the senior naval officer for a combined assault on Canton, and warned all
Europeans to leave the place forthwith. By the evening of the 23rd of May
the navy, after hard work in bombarding the river forts by day and warding
off the approach of fire-rafts by night, had prepared the way for the execution
of Sir Hugh Gough’s plan for the capture of Canton. This city of a million
inhabitants was surrounded by walls of great thickness, and from twenty-five
to twenty-eight feet in height; its ramparts, bristling with guns, were
manned by forty-five thousand regular soldiers and an equal number of
militia. To the west, south, and east of the town were large and prosperous
suburbs, but on the north this expansion had been checked by a range of
heights which, running parallel with the northern wall, completely dominated
Canton and its defences. The Chinese had realised that if these heights
passed into the hands of the British the town would become untenable: not
only had they defended them with four strong forts, armed with forty-two
heavy guns, but they had formed a large entrenched camp outside the north-eastern
corner of the city, in order further to secure the safety of the heights
which they rightly anticipated would be the point of our attack. Such was
the position against which Gough, with less than 2800 soldiers, sailors, and
marines, was about to try his strength. He divided his little force into two
columns of very unequal size.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> The right, or smaller detachment, was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
force its way through the western suburb as far as the European settlement,
or, as it was locally termed, “the factories”; occupy it, and place it in a state
of defence. General Gough took personal command of the left or larger
column, which consisted of four so-called brigades, the largest of which had in
the ranks less than 900 officers and men. When the left column had been
transhipped into all kinds of craft, from smart men-of-war’s gigs to lumbering
native tea junks, it was towed in a motley procession of about eighty boats
for five miles up a creek of the river to Tingpoo, a village about three
miles and a half from the western base of the northern heights. Here the
fourth brigade landed without opposition, just as the guns of the fleet were
thundering out a royal salute in honour of the birthday of Queen Victoria.
With the 49th regiment Sir Hugh Gough made a rapid reconnaissance
inland, and then, leaving outposts behind him, returned to superintend the
disembarkation of the main body.</p>

<p>Daylight on the 25th saw the whole column in motion, slowly threading
its way, often in single file, over the densely cultivated rice-fields which lay
between Tingpoo and their objective. The XVIIIth was ordered to leave an
officer and thirty men at the landing-place to keep open the communications
and to protect stores; the duty fell to Lieutenant W. P. Cockburn, who distinguished
himself by the skill he displayed a few hours later in beating off
an attack by a considerable body of the enemy. Until the infantry were
within range of the western pair of forts the Chinese remained silent; then a
heavy fire from their guns forced Gough to halt until his artillery could be
brought into action. By eight <span class="fs70">A.M.</span> the gunners had succeeded in dragging
two 5½-in. mortars, two 12-pr. howitzers, two 12-pr. field-pieces, and a
rocket battery to within 600 yards of the two western forts. These they
bombarded vigorously, while the General reconnoitred and issued his orders
for the assault: the Naval brigade was to storm the western forts, while the
1st and 4th brigades were to drive the Chinese from the hills close to the
eastern forts. Under cover of our guns the troops advanced, exposed to a
heavy but fortunately ill-directed fire: with great dash the sailors wrested the
western forts from the enemy, who fought with stubbornness though without
skill; the infantry swept over the heights with such vigour that the Chinese
deserted the eastern forts before the troops had time to close upon them; and
the Marines, who had been detached from Burrell to cope with a demonstration
against our right flank and rear, disposed of their antagonists with little
trouble. In the charge of the XVIIIth upon the forts the grenadier company
led in extended order, accompanied by the General, who in his despatch
reported that it had seldom fallen to his lot to “witness a more soldier-like
and steady advance, or a more animated attack. Every individual steadily
and gallantly did his duty. The XVIIIth and 49th were emulous which
should first reach the appointed goals; but under the impulse of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
feeling they did not lose sight of that discipline which could alone ensure
success.”</p>

<p>Though the ridge had been won with such ease, the day’s work was by no
means over. As soon as the Chinese realised that the forts were lost, they
opened from the city walls so heavy a fire of guns, gingals, and matchlocks
that it became necessary to keep the British troops well under cover, and part
of the garrison of the entrenched camp advanced into a village, threatening
our left flank. The 49th dislodged them, but later in the day there was such
animation in the camp that Gough ordered Burrell to storm it with the Royal
Irish, under Lieutenant-Colonel H. Adams, and a company of Marines.
Between the foot of the heights held by the British and the enemy’s entrenchments
stretched a great expanse of rice-fields deep in water; a narrow
causeway bridged this inundation, and along it, under a galling fire, the
XVIIIth advanced at the double, scattered the enemy in every direction, set
fire to the tents, and blew up the magazines. This success was not a bloodless
one&mdash;three officers were wounded, and there were some casualties in the other
ranks. The assault was led by Captain Grattan, whose “spirited conduct” on
this occasion led Gough to select him to carry despatches to the Governor-General
of India.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> With the capture of the village the operations ended, for
though Gough was burning to assault the northern wall of the town, his
heavy guns were not yet in position, and his infantry, out of training from
their long detention on board ship, were completely exhausted by the
abnormal heat of the day. To this exhaustion the unsuitable dress of
the soldiers doubtless contributed not a little. Notwithstanding the protests
of the doctors the men still wore tightly buttoned red coatees or
shell jackets, stocks, and blue Nankin trousers; and their headgear was
a huge shako or a small forage cap, both useless in an almost tropical
climate.</p>

<p>Gough’s little force bivouacked on the heights they had won, elated at
their own success and at that of the right column, which had made good its
position in “the factories.” Early on the 26th, before our artillery was
ready to open fire, the Chinese sent a messenger to say that they desired
peace; Gough replied that before entering into any negotiations he must
see the Chinese General, and in waiting for this elusive personage, who
never appeared, several hours were wasted; then torrents of rain rendered
any movements impossible, and Gough had to content himself with completing
his preparations for the storming of the city wall on the 27th. But
in his plans he had not reckoned with the Plenipotentiary, who, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
consulting the officers commanding the naval and military forces, agreed with
the Chinese to accept an indemnity of six millions of dollars, to be paid
within six days, when the whole expedition was to retire from the Canton
river. Remonstrances were useless, for the Plenipotentiary was supreme,
and after several anxious days spent in skirmishing with the local irregular
troops, the soldiers re-embarked and the fleet once more returned to Hong
Kong, leaving the Chinese more firmly convinced than ever that the English
were as easy to hoodwink in diplomacy as they were difficult to fight in
battle. These operations cost fourteen killed and ninety-one wounded. The
casualties in the Royal Irish were Captain J. J. Sargent, Lieutenants D.
Edwardes and G. Hilliard wounded, and five men killed or wounded.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>Owing to a combination of adverse circumstances nothing was accomplished
by sea or land for some months. The Plenipotentiary, ever engaged
in futile negotiations with the Chinese, could not bring himself to accept the
active policy pressed upon him by Sir Hugh Gough, who pointed out that
the Emperor of China would never respect us until the expedition had forced
a passage up the great waterway of the Yang-Tse-Kiang, and struck a
vigorous blow at the heart of the Celestial Empire. A great typhoon drove
many ships ashore, dismasted others, and blew down part of the settlement at
Hong Kong. Malarial fever, caught in the rice grounds around Canton, became
so prevalent that at one time two-thirds of the troops were unfit for duty.
The Royal Irish did not suffer more than other corps, yet on August 1, six
weeks after a draft had raised their strength to 747 all told, 136 of the
regiment were in hospital, and three officers died.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> With the arrival of Sir
Henry Pottinger, the new Plenipotentiary, the aspect of affairs changed; and
on the 21st of August the regiment formed part of the column embarked for
the attack of Amoy&mdash;a seaport three hundred miles up the coast towards the
mouth of the Yang-Tse-Kiang. The position of Amoy is naturally strong,
and since the beginning of the war it had been so greatly fortified that, after
it was taken, soldiers and sailors agreed that it would have proved impregnable
had it been defended by Europeans. Amoy stands at the head of a bay
studded with islands, the most considerable of which, Kulangsu, commands
both the city and the strait or channel, only six hundred yards in width,
by which the inner harbour is entered. From every island and from every
headland guns frowned upon the bay, and, to quote Gough’s biographer&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“immediately in front of the outer town stood a succession of batteries,
and from these there extended a solid rampart, facing the sea, about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
a mile in length. It was, says an eye-witness, ‘well built of granite,
faced with earth, extending along the shore nearly up to the suburbs of
the city, and designed to command the passage to the harbour. It
presented a line of guns, a full mile in length, the embrasures being
covered with large slabs of stone protected by earth heaped upon them, and
mounting no less than ninety-six guns.’ The end of this rampart was
connected by a castellated wall with a range of rocky heights running
parallel to the beach and the rampart, which was thus protected from a
flanking attack.... On the island of Kulangsu there were several
strong batteries, mounting altogether seventy-six guns, and some of these
faced the long stone rampart on the opposite side of the strait, thus
exposing the assailants to a cross-fire.”<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p></div>

<p>The naval and military commanders decided that the works of Amoy
and Kulangsu should be attacked at the same time; the ships were to
bombard them in front, while the troops took them in reverse. The
morning of the 26th of August saw the plan carried into effect: the
batteries at Kulangsu fell easily into our hands: those at Amoy were
so strongly built that though two line-of-battle ships poured many thousands
of projectiles into them at 400 yards’ range, the masonry was practically
uninjured. The cannonade, however, served its purpose in preventing the
Chinese gunners from sinking the boats in which the XVIIIth and 49th were
carried to their appointed landing-place at the foot of the castellated wall.
While the Royal Irish, scaling this wall, turned the flank of the works on the
sea front, the 49th rushed along the shore and scrambled over the parapet of
the great battery; both regiments swept the work from end to end, driving
the Chinese before them, and then joined the Marines, who had occupied the
heights. Here they commanded the “outer city”; but the “inner city” was
protected by a range of hills occupied by a large number of the enemy.
Gough ordered the 49th to turn these hills, and sent the XVIIIth straight
at the Chinese, up a steep gorge where a few men could have checked
a regiment. The Chinese, however, made a very poor resistance; the troops
bivouacked on the heights, and next morning occupied the citadel and “inner
city” of Amoy. The total British loss was seventeen killed and wounded;
among the latter were two men of the Royal Irish. The Chinese suffered
severely, and several of their leaders committed suicide rather than accept
defeat.</p>

<p>The adventures of the XVIIIth on this occasion are amusingly described by
Lieutenant A. Murray, the officer in command of the picked shots of the
regiment, who throughout the campaign worked together under his orders&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We got into boats about 12 o’clock, and were taken in tow
by the steamer <i>Nemesis</i>,<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> and as we had to go to the different ships<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
to collect the men, we were towed about the harbour for a long time,
at the imminent risk of being capsized, as the string of boats increased
every minute, and consequently threading our way through the fleet
became more dangerous. I cut one boat adrift to prevent her sinking
us, as she was twice our size and was pounding us to pieces, the Colours
of the regiment being in the boat with me.... The steamer stood
pretty closely into the shore, and the boats cast off, the <i>Nemesis</i> covering
our landing with her guns and rockets. Our Grenadier and Light companies,
and marksmen, under the command of Major Tomlinson, were
ordered to move to the front to take the flanking wall of the battery,
which was done very easily, and they (<em>i.e.</em>, the Chinese) only fired a few
shots and a volley of rockets. We got over the wall by stepping on each
others’ backs. On seeing us come over the wall the Chinese, who till
then had stood to their guns, ... now ran in all directions, throwing
their large shields over their backs.”</p></div>

<p>After capturing a Mandarin’s flag Murray followed the grenadier and light
companies along the rear of the batteries, where a number of the enemy came
at them boldly; the Chinese were soon dispersed, however, and fell back to a
clump of aloe bushes, from which they were driven by a second charge. Of the
bivouac Murray writes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It was almost night when we reached the summit of the heights and
there were ordered to halt for the night. This was rather a pleasant
look-out for tired and hungry men, without anything to eat or a house to
sleep in, with a bitter cold wind blowing; however there was nothing for
it but to choose the softest possible rock, light a cheroot and fancy
yourself comfortable for the night.... There was great picking and
choosing among us for soft rocks; but I believe we all came to the
conclusion that one rock is as hard a pillow as another.”<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p></div>

<p>After destroying the batteries and securing the five hundred guns captured
at Amoy, the expeditionary force put to sea, leaving as garrison of Kulangsu
361 officers and men of the XVIIIth under Major J. Cowper, part of the
26th, and a detachment of artillery&mdash;a total of 550 of all ranks. The
intention was to attack the towns of Chinhai and Ningpo, and then, in
order to efface the bad impression produced by our evacuation of Chusan
at the beginning of the year, to re-occupy that island. Bad weather, however,
scattered the ships, and, when at length they were reassembled it
was decided at once to seize Tinghae, the capital of Chusan, before the
Chinese had finished their preparations for its defence. Since we had
abandoned it our enemy had fortified the town assiduously. On the sea
wall facing the harbour a battery of eighty guns had been thrown up.
On the west it ended at the base of an eminence, in our previous occupation
known as Pagoda Hill, where cannon were now mounted; to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
eastward it stretched almost to the foot of a line of heights, entrenched
but not yet armed. Gough decided to land at the foot of these heights,
and after carrying them to push some of the troops against the town,
while others attacked the long battery from flank and rear. The ships
were to avoid the fire of the guns on the sea front by taking up their
stations on the outer flanks of Pagoda Hill and the eastern heights. The
fleet came into action on October 1, 1841, and covered by their bombardment
three hundred of the Royal Irish under Lieutenant-Colonel Adams,
the newly arrived 55th regiment, and eight guns of the Madras Artillery
disembarked under a heavy though ill-aimed fire of matchlocks and gingals.
The 55th won the eastern heights, though not without difficulty, for the
garrison of Tinghae were soldiers of a better stamp than the defenders of
Amoy. The Royal Irish were sent off to the right, marching in quarter
column and covered by the flank companies and picked marksmen, who
ran into the enemy at an encampment near the long battery. Here the
Chinese showed fight, and lost considerably in hand-to-hand work. Murray
relates that a “white-buttoned” Mandarin,<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> after wounding one of the marksmen
in the chest with a spear, “closed with him and got his forage cap off,
another man came up and thrust at him with a bayonet, which he wrenched
off, but was shot by a third.” While the sharpshooters were thus employed
the grenadier company had made its way into the long battery, where there
was a sharp skirmish at close quarters round a gun. The Chinese stood
bravely, and were not dislodged until another company of the regiment
came up at the double, when they fell back, leaving the ground covered
with their own wounded and a few of the XVIIIth. In this little fight
pistols were used with effect. A Chinaman ran at Murray, sword in hand,
but as the hero of the adventure writes, “having no particular confidence
in my regulation spit, or perhaps in my own skill as a swordsman, I stuck
my sword in the mud beside me, took a steady aim, and shot him.” As
soon as the Royal Irish had cleared the long battery of the enemy they
climbed Pagoda Hill, to find that its garrison had been driven away by the
shot and shell of the men-of-war and the artillery. As the Colours of the
XVIIIth were raised on the top of the hill, those of the 55th began to
float over the walls of Tinghae, and the capital of Chusan once more
passed into our hands at the cost of some thirty killed and wounded. In
the XVIIIth the casualties were a sergeant and six rank and file wounded.
The loss of Chusan greatly annoyed the Chinese, who complained that we
had not fought them fairly. Instead of anchoring our ships right under
the cannon of the long battery and making a frontal attack by sea and
land, as they expected, we had meanly bombarded the extreme ends of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
their line of defence, landed where their guns could not play upon us,
and taken the battery in flank. Had cricket been one of the national
institutions of China, the beaten troops would doubtless have said that we
had not played the game!</p>

<p>Leaving an adequate garrison in Chusan General Gough next attacked
Chinhai, a seaport at the mouth of the Ningpo river, twelve miles from
the important city of Ningpo. Its fortifications, though strong, were easily
turned on the 10th of October, when the place was taken with a total loss
of four killed and sixteen wounded. One man in the Royal Irish was
killed<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> and four wounded. The Chinese suffered very heavily, for here,
as elsewhere in the campaign, their arms were as indifferent as their shooting,
and after standing well for a time they broke before a charge, and were
then mowed down in every direction. The slaughter of the fugitives was a
hideous necessity: we were but a handful in an enormous country, and our
enemies were so numerous that we should have been overwhelmed by numbers
had we not inflicted severe punishment upon them in every engagement.
To the bad marksmanship of the Chinese must be attributed the XVIIIth’s
good luck on this occasion. As the Royal Irish approached the range of
strongly held hills which they were to seize, they found themselves on the
bank of an unfordable canal, well under the enemy’s fire. This canal was
spanned by a bridge, narrow in itself, and made still narrower by an arch
across it; the archway was blocked by a large stone, and even after this
obstruction had been removed the passage was so small that the men had
to take off their great-coats in order to squeeze through it one by one.
“We had one or two very stout fellows,” wrote one of the officers present,
“whom we had great difficulty in pushing through, but when we came to
the big drum we <em>were</em> in a fix. However, we got a little boat, and put
McGiff, the big drummer, and his drum into it, with a pole to shove himself
across. The Chinese thought the big drum was some new form of
infernal machine, and opened a tremendous fire upon it, much to our amusement,
but it was anything but fun for McGiff. He and the drum, however,
got over safe and sound, except the drum heads, which were much damaged
by bullets.”</p>

<p>Three days later Ningpo fell without a shot being fired, and the little
army was played into the town by the band of the XVIIIth. Here Gough
was obliged to halt: much as he desired to push on to the banks of the Yang-Tse-Kiang
he could not do so without troops, and sickness, casualties, and the
drain of the garrisons of Hong Kong, Kulangsu, Tinghae, and Chinhai had left
him with only about seven hundred and fifty men in hand. With so slender
a force he could do nothing but await reinforcements; and for several months
the headquarters of the XVIIIth and 49th remained at Ningpo, occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
employed in demonstrations to postpone the attack which, as he rightly
anticipated, could not be long delayed. Beyond these demonstrations there
was little to break the monotony of existence in this Chinese city. The
duty was heavy. Nearly five miles of continuous wall, twenty-seven feet
high, twenty feet broad, and broken only by six gates, surrounded the town:
each of these entrances required a strong guard; the town was patrolled
several times during the twenty-four hours; and the field officer and captain
of the day, mounted on sure-footed Chinese ponies, rode frequently round
the ramparts to visit ground which could not be watched by the sentries
on the gates. Once a week the Colours were trooped in the presence of the
General, who insisted on the attendance of all officers not otherwise employed.
When troops were available there was drill in a large square, to the great
delight of a number of little native boys who had attached themselves to
the Royal Irish. These children hung about the temple, which had been
converted into a barrack, and did odd jobs for the men, helping them to
cook and to carry dinners to the guards. In return for these kind offices
the soldiers made pets of the boys, and taught them military expressions
with such assiduity that in a short time “almost all the young blackguards
about the place could swear in very good English.” These youngsters
proved their friendship with the XVIIIth by confirming the rumours, already
current, that during the absence of Sir Hugh Gough, who had been
summoned to a conference at Chusan with Sir Henry Pottinger, a great
army was about to attack Ningpo; and after warning their soldier friends
that next day there was going to be a great fight, they disappeared. This
warning was repeated by the traders in the market, who drew their hands
across their throats to give their British customers to understand that all
the “Barbarians” would soon be killed. In the night of March 9-10, 1842,
large bodies of the enemy simultaneously assaulted the south and west
gates. The attack on the former was successful; the Chinese forced it
open, routed the guard, and were making their way into the centre of the
town when they were met by part of the 49th, who drove them through
the gate and back into the suburbs with heavy loss. The west gate was
held by Lieutenant A. W. S. F. Armstrong and twenty-eight men of the
XVIIIth, carefully picked among the best soldiers of the regiment by the
adjutant, Lieutenant Graves, who, like every one of the garrison at Ningpo
except the officer in temporary command, had realised that there was trouble
in the air. Five minutes after the bugles had sounded the alarm the
Royal Irish were on parade, and two companies went off at the double to
reinforce Armstrong’s guard, who, owing to the construction of the parapet,
were unable to fire down upon the Tartars as they strove to lever the
gate off its hinges with crowbars and axes. Suddenly among the defenders
appeared a private, Michael Cushin, described as a first-class soldier with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
only one failing, who seems to have been the hero of the defence. He had
been imprisoned for drunkenness at the west gate, and when the attack
began, begged to be released. As soon as his cell was opened, he wrenched the
bar off the door and began to use it on the Tartars’ heads: next he killed
the officer commanding a party of the enemy on the point of clambering
over the parapet: then his quick wits solved the problem of the ill-planned
rampart. Collecting ten or twelve men, they put their shoulders to the
part of it which overhung the gate, and with a few great heaves topped
the mass of masonry into the crowd below.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Through the gap thus made
the guard began to ply their muskets, and when the supports arrived
with a light gun, a murderous fire was opened upon the Tartars, who
sullenly abandoned the assault and retired, leaving two silk banners as
trophies in the hands of the XVIIIth. After the south gate had been re-occupied
a handful of British soldiers, among whom were some of the
Royal Irish, pushed their way through the town, and near one of the
gates found a great number of the enemy drawn up across the street. The
infantry reserved their volley until twenty yards from the Tartars, the guns
fired canister at fifty yards’ range, and a party of the regiment, under
Lieutenant Murray, after breaking through a house and fording a canal,
occupied the side streets of the thoroughfare down which the enemy was
driven, and by their musketry contributed much to his great losses. For
six miles the Tartars were hunted, first through the suburb and then in
the open country, but there was no fight left in them, and the civilian
inhabitants who crowded the streets and roads gave them no help, and
appeared to regard the fighting as a spectacle arranged for their own
amusement. The attitude of most of the Chinese throughout the campaign,
indeed, was one of complete apathy: they looked upon the war as
an annoying but unavoidable interruption to their daily life, and finding
that their conquerors treated them well, acquiesced in their presence, and
made as much money out of them as possible.</p>

<p>The enemy attacked Chinhai about the same time that he attempted to
wrest Ningpo from us, but was beaten off with ease by the garrison, largely
composed of a detachment of the Royal Irish under Brevet-Major Grattan.
A few days after these exciting little episodes, the XVIIIth was present at
successful raids against the town of Tze-Ke and other places near Ningpo;
but as those of the Royal Irish who were in the column hardly came into
action it is unnecessary to describe these skirmishes. About this time
Colonel Adams, being invalided home, was succeeded in command by Lieutenant-Colonel
N. R. Tomlinson; and in the month of April three companies
of the detachment at Kulangsu rejoined headquarters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>It has already been mentioned that ever since Sir Hugh Gough’s arrival
he had pointed out that the war would never be brought to a satisfactory
conclusion until, abandoning the policy of attacking only the towns on the
sea-coast, we pushed our way into the heart of the country, and threatened the
Emperor in his palace at Pekin. After much correspondence between the
Ministry at home and the Governor-General of India at Calcutta, Gough’s
strategy was adopted, and in May, 1842, the XVIIIth was afloat again, this
time bound for Chapoo, where a naval arsenal was to be destroyed before
the fleet entered the river Yang-Tse-Kiang. The place was strongly fortified,
but, as usual, the enemy proved unprepared for anything but a frontal attack,
and as soon as his works were turned on the 18th of May he was easily
routed, except at one point, where the stubborn valour of the Tartar soldiery
cost the regiment dear. Finding their retreat cut off, three hundred of these
men flung themselves into a large stone house, and determined to take
no quarter but to fight to the bitter end. The building was quickly and
skilfully prepared for defence. The outer windows were manned by picked
shots; the interior passages and the central hall were loopholed; mats were
hung to exclude the light, so that if the British succeeded in making their
way across the threshold they would plunge into semi-darkness, and not see
the loopholes from which they would be shot down by a cross fire. A party
of the Royal Irish tried to force their way into this death-trap, but were so
warmly received that Lieutenant Murray, who was in command, drew off his
men to wait for reinforcements; and after a similar attempt by some of the
49th had been repulsed, the house was surrounded by skirmishers to prevent
the escape of any of the enemy. Before long, more companies of the XVIIIth
and 49th came on the scene, and the officer in command of the latter corps,
who was the senior officer present, decided not to press the attack until the
Tartars had been shaken by artillery. The decision was a wise one, but
unfortunately Lieutenant-Colonel Tomlinson overheard some expressions
which he considered a reflection either upon his regiment or himself, and
instantly led a headlong charge towards the entrance of the house. At the
door he fell, so desperately injured that in five minutes he had ceased to
breathe, while every man who tried to enter with him was killed or wounded.
After he was shot down it became almost impossible to prevent the XVIIIth
from rushing madly at the building, for the men burned to avenge their
Colonel, whom they described as “the best officer who ever said ‘Come on’ to
a grenadier company.” In more formal language General Gough recorded
the same opinion, saying in his despatch that Tomlinson fell “in full career
of renown, honoured by the corps, and lamented by all.”</p>

<p>When a few artillerymen came up with a light gun and some rockets
they opened on the house, but without result; equally fruitless were the
efforts of a party of sailors to set fire to the woodwork of the upper storeys;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
then the explosion of a powder-bag made a small breach in a wall through
which a few of the Royal Irish tried to force their way, only to be driven
back with loss. A second attempt to set fire to the woodwork, however, was
more successful, and the explosion of another powder-bag brought down more
of the wall, and thus exposed many of the Tartars to our musketry. Soon
the whole place was in a blaze, and when at last our men rushed through
the doorway from which they had been so often repulsed, they found themselves
in a hell on Earth. Three hundred Tartars had defended the building;
now all but fifty-three lay dead upon the floor; and of the survivors nearly
all were wounded. Many of their wadded cotton uniforms had taken fire,
and to the horrors of the reek of blood and the stench of singeing flesh
were added the cries of the wounded, as they feebly strove to beat out the
sparks which fell from the roof upon their clothing. In the midst of this
scene of carnage sat an old Tartar colonel, who, when the red-coats began
to show through the smoke, laid down his pipe, snatched up his sword, and
cut his throat. This stout old warrior failed to kill himself, and with the
rest of the wounded was tended by our doctors, and then released&mdash;a chivalrous
recognition of their bravery which greatly astonished the prisoners
and convinced them that the “foreign devils” were not as black as the
Mandarins had painted them. The discovery, unfortunately, came too late
to prevent an epidemic of suicide among the population of Chapoo. When
our men entered the town it was full of dead: “men, women, and children
were found drowned or hanged; whole families seemed to have destroyed
themselves, and some, from the positions they were in, must have had
difficulty and most desperate resolution to effect their purpose. The wells
and every place where they could find water enough were full of bodies.”<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>The Chinese are believed to have fought Gough’s little army of 2200
men<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> at Chapoo with 8000 regular troops, 1700 of whom were Tartars.
Their losses were, as usual, enormous&mdash;from 1200 to 1500&mdash;while those of
the British were two officers and eleven other ranks killed, six officers and
forty-six other ranks wounded. The casualties among the XVIIIth were
heavy: Colonel Tomlinson, a sergeant, and three privates were killed;<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
Lieutenants A. Murray and E. Jodrell, a sergeant, a drummer, and twenty-seven
rank and file were wounded. One of the pay-sergeants had a very
narrow escape: he was in the habit of carrying the company roll in his
forage cap, and when at nightfall he wanted to make entries in it he found
it cut to pieces by bullets.</p>

<p>As soon as the arsenal, guns, and other munitions of war at Chapoo were
destroyed, the expedition made sail for the Yang-Tse-Kiang, where we bombarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Woosung, a town at the mouth of the river of the same name.
Though small, the place was heavily fortified, for the Chinese trusted to its
guns for the protection of the lower reaches of the river. In the capture of
Woosung the army played no part, for the troopships were aground on mud-banks
when the sailors and marines, after knocking the batteries to pieces,
landed to take possession of the town. Two days later, on the 19th of June,
the Royal Irish formed part of a column which marched fourteen miles
inland to Shanghai, destroyed the warlike stores at this great centre of
trade, and then returned to Woosung, to find that during their short absence
some batteries of Royal Artillery, the 98th, and several Madras regiments had
joined the force, and that Major J. Cowper had come up from Kulangsu to
take command of the XVIIIth, bringing with him the company which had
been left to garrison Chinhai. The fleet remained storm-bound at Woosung
until the 7th of July: then the weather moderated, and the Admiral, Sir
William Parker, ordered his seventy vessels&mdash;men-of-war, transports, and
store ships&mdash;to weigh anchor for Nankin, now the object of our operations.
This enormous city was the commercial capital of China, and the centre of a
great network of canals connecting Pekin with the Yang-Tse-Kiang and the
southern provinces of the Empire. Once masters of Nankin, we could stop
all inland traffic on the canals, and by paralysing the commerce of the
country bring irresistible pressure on the Emperor, six hundred miles away
in his Court at Pekin. The task before the Navy was a heavy one. In
peace time the mere passage of so large a number of ships over a hundred and
seventy miles of an almost unknown river would have presented difficulties.
Now these difficulties were increased by the necessity of guarding against
attack, and by the knowledge that before the guns of the fleet could be
trained upon the walls of Nankin we would have to fight the garrison of
at least one large town on the banks of the river. The steamers scouted
upstream, sounding and surveying as they went: the sailing ships followed
in a stately procession many miles in length, watched by crowds of peasants
who gazed in wonder at the “war junks” of the Barbarians. On the 20th of
July, the rearmost of the fleet reached Chinkiangfu, a walled city fifty miles
below Nankin; and next day Gough landed his troops, now numbering 6664
men. The first brigade (Major-General Lord Saltoun) was to clear the
enemy from a camp south-west of the town; with the second, Major-General
Schoedde was to attack the northern wall of the town; to Bartley’s brigade
(the third) was entrusted the storming of the western wall. The first brigade
did its work easily; the second had hard fighting before its bayonets
glittered on the northern wall; the third brigade, and especially the XVIIIth
regiment, had exciting adventures in carrying out the duty assigned to them.</p>

<p>The Royal Irish were the last troops to disembark. They did not land
till seven <span class="fs70">A.M.</span>, when the heat was already so oppressive that the Adjutant,
Lieutenant Graves, persuaded Major Cowper to leave the men’s great-coats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
behind, undertaking to provide the entire regiment with furs from the shops
of the pawnbrokers, with whom the wealthy Chinese regularly stored their
winter clothing. To go into action without great-coats was quite a new
departure, but even more daring was the next order: the men were told to
take off their stocks, sling them over the left shoulder, and unfasten three
buttons of their jackets and three buttons of their collars! These precautions,
though to our ideas not very far-reaching, served their purpose, for while in
other corps numbers of men were knocked over by the heat, not a man in the
XVIIIth suffered from sunstroke. The regiment was making its way
through the suburbs to the western face of the wall, when an A.D.C. arrived
with orders for the Royal Irish to come up at the double to the western gate,
where the General was anxiously awaiting them. The troops around General
Gough were in bad case: many lay senseless from sun apoplexy; the
remainder were so exhausted that they could only keep up a feeble fire on
its defenders. As soon as the XVIIIth appeared Gough welcomed them with
the order “Go on, Royal Irish, and storm.” “We halted,” writes an officer
who was present, “to tell off a storming party of fifty men, and then with
arms at the trail and bending low, the stormers made a dash down a cross-street
within about twenty yards of the gate, and from the windows of the
houses which ran parallel to the wall, we opened fire on the Chinese gunners
and soon silenced them. The engineers then advanced and placed a powder-bag
against the gate (a very strong one and, as we afterwards found,
strengthened by four or five tiers of sand-bags piled against it from inside);
we were ordered to lie down; the fuse was lit, and in about ten seconds
everything was flying about our heads. This brought us to our feet in a
hurry; we gave a cheer and dashed into the archway, which was densely
filled with smoke; those who got in first were soon brought to their knees by
kicking against the sand-bags which we could not see, but we had to scramble
on as quick as possible as there was danger of receiving a poke from a
friendly bayonet behind! We got out as black as monkeys, to find ourselves
in a sort of yard, surrounded by high walls, with a second gate leading from
it into the city. We had just started breaking this second gate down, when
we heard a friendly voice behind it shouting ‘Hold on, we’ll open it for
you!’” It turned out that the 55th, after escalading their own wall, had
worked round to the western gate, which the Chinese abandoned when they
saw their flank in danger.</p>

<p>The Royal Irish were at once sent to drive the Tartars from the western
wall. They moved off left in front,<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> and as there was not room on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
rampart for four men abreast they marched in threes. The grenadier company
were soon dropped to hold a commanding building close to the wall; the
remainder of the regiment pushed on without seeing any of the enemy, until a
keen-eyed officer noticed a large number of Tartars emerging from the shelter
of some houses on the town side of the wall. The commanding officer,
insisting that they were not fighting men but harmless coolies, refused to send
out skirmishers to protect the head and right flank of his straggling
column, and the Tartars were allowed to establish themselves in gardens
surrounded by high walls, which made excellent rests for matchlocks and
gingals. As soon as the regiment was within range they opened a heavy fire
upon the leading company, killing Captain C. J. R. Collinson, wounding
Lieutenant S. Bernard, and causing several casualties in the ranks. The
rampart along which the XVIIIth was marching was so narrow that it was
difficult for messengers to pass rapidly from company to company, and as no
orders were received the men halted for directions: but by the time the
enemy had discharged a second volley, an officer had called upon the Light
company to avenge their captain. Collinson’s “Light Bobs” dashed down the
slope of the rampart, scaled the mud walls and, followed by the remainder of
the regiment, fell furiously on the Tartars, who, after a stout resistance, broke
and fled. Not all, however, of the enemy had lost heart. Just as the
regiment had re-formed after the charge, a gigantic Tartar rushed towards the
line, brandishing a sword in each hand; the officers, unwilling to send so
brave a man to his death, made signs to him to retire, but in vain, and he was
almost amongst the men when a well-aimed bullet laid him low. The
grenadier company came in for a full share of the excitements of the day.
Their captain, Wigston, noticed some of the Tartars drawn up across a
narrow street leading to his post, and sent a subaltern, Lieutenant W. Venour,
and twelve men to dislodge them. The Tartars held their fire until the party
of grenadiers were close to them, and then let fly with some effect. Lieutenant
I. H. Hewitt with fourteen men hurried up to reinforce Venour’s detachment,
and the street was cleared after sharp hand-to-hand fighting. Hewitt had a
narrow escape: a Tartar cut at him with his sword, and the blow would have
been fatal had not Private M‘Carthy “raised his musket and parried it, though
unfortunately with the loss of his thumb, the sword cutting right through
the bone, and also through Hewitt’s forage cap, slightly raising the skin of his
head. We left a picket there,” continues Lieutenant Murray, “as occasional
shots were still fired from the houses. A short time afterwards a Tartar
soldier rushed in amongst the men and stabbed one of them in the side with
his knife: he was shot instantly. We were obliged to set fire to the houses
to drive the Tartars out of them, for we would not let the men follow them
into the buildings.”</p>

<p>Although the troops did their best to stop the frenzy of rage and terror<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
which seized upon the population after we had captured the town, the number
of people who committed suicide at Chinkiangfu was as great or even greater
than at Chapoo. One instance among hundreds will prove how determined
the Tartars were not to survive the disgrace of a defeat. When their General
realised that the day was lost he retired to his house, ordered his servants to
set fire to the building, and allowed himself to be burned to death. It was
fortunate for the success of Gough’s little army that the overweening contempt
of the Chinese for foreigners had prevented the employment of
European adventurers to mould and lead their armies. Had the Tartar troops
been trained and disciplined by Continental soldiers of fortune, as were the
Sikhs, the enemies whom Gough was to encounter in a few years, a great
array of British soldiers would have been required to win on the banks of the
Yang-Tse-Kiang victories as decisive as those of Sobraon and Goozerat.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> In
the capture of Chinkiangfu two officers and thirty of the other ranks were
killed, eleven officers and ninety-eight other ranks wounded, and three privates
missing. The casualties among the small Naval landing party were three
killed and twenty-one wounded. The XVIIIth lost one officer, Captain
Collinson, and two private soldiers killed; one officer, Lieutenant S. Bernard,
two sergeants, and fifteen privates wounded.</p>

<p>While the soldiers were fighting on shore, the sailors were doing invaluable
work on their own element by blockading the chief waterways to Pekin; and
in a few days the result of the stoppage of trade with the capital was so
disastrous to the merchants of China that the Emperor was obliged to sue for
peace. But before negotiations had been opened, Pottinger, Gough, and
Parker realised that the presence of British troops and British ships at
Nankin would greatly stimulate the tardy movements of the Chinese diplomatists,
and on August 9, 1842, the whole force, less a small garrison left to
hold Chinkiangfu, was ready to assault the walls of the commercial capital of
China. But no assault was necessary, as twenty days later a treaty of
peace, this time a genuine one on the part of the Chinese, was signed on board
a British man-of-war. Its terms were satisfactory: every point on which
England had gone to war was ceded by the Emperor; our national honour
was vindicated, and the rights of our traders secured. During the negotiations
dignified courtesies were exchanged between the Mandarins and the Plenipotentiary.
On one of these occasions the grenadier company of the Royal
Irish acted as guard of honour to Sir Henry Pottinger while he solemnly
dined with the Chinese officials: our late enemies turned out their best soldiers
to receive the English guests, but though Lieutenant Murray admits that
among them were many tall, fine-looking fellows, he insists that they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
“nothing in appearance to our company, who looked remarkably well, and
must have astonished the Chinese much.” Though the spectators doubtless
admired the physique and martial bearing of the Irishmen who had so often
routed the picked troops of China, they must have smiled at the contrast
between the comfortable dress of the Tartars, who wore long loose coats and
boots coming well up the leg, and the stocks, tightly buttoned shell-jackets
and equally tight white trousers of the British army.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> The spies among the
crowd, for the Chinese had many very observant secret service agents in their
employ, must have wondered why the infantry who served on board ship
were armed with percussion muskets, while those who fought on land carried
flint-locks.</p>

<p>No sooner had the treaty of peace been officially ratified by the Emperor
of China than the expedition began to descend the Yang-Tse-Kiang with all
speed, for the climate had begun to tell heavily upon the health of soldiers
and sailors alike. So short-handed from sickness was the crew of H.M.S.
<i>Rattlesnake</i> that the Royal Irish, by this time nearly as much at home on
a ship as in a barrack, helped largely in working her successfully down
the river. At the mouth of the Yang-Tse-Kiang the expedition broke up:
some of Gough’s units sailed for India; others went home, while the corps
ordered to remain in Chinese waters proceeded to their several destinations.
Among the latter was the XVIIIth, which was sent to Chusan, where its
various detachments were assembled by the end of October, 1842. When the
casualty returns were prepared it was found that though the losses in action
had been small, those caused by dysentery, malaria, and cholera had been very
heavy. Lieutenant-Colonel N. R. Tomlinson and Captain C. J. R. Collinson
had been killed; Major R. Hammill, Lieutenants H. Vavasour, A. Wilson,
F. Swinburn, D. Edwardes, J. Cochrane, G. W. Davis, S. Haly, Hon. C. H.
Stratford, Ensign M. Humphreys, and Assistant-Surgeon J. Baker had died
from disease; six officers had been wounded but had recovered from their
injuries. Among the other ranks nine non-commissioned officers and men
had been killed, seventy-seven wounded, and two hundred and fourteen had
died from illness, accident, or the effect of wounds.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> In honour of those who
perished a monument was erected in St Patrick’s Cathedral. It stands in the
north transept&mdash;the Walhalla of the regiment, where the old Colours, faded by
the sun in many climes and pierced by bullets in many battles, overhang the
stately memorials by which the Royal Irish regiment has sought to keep green
the memory of its illustrious dead. The numerous monuments are described<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
fully in <a href="#APPENDIX_10">Appendix 10</a>, and photographs of them are reproduced in various
parts of the book.</p>

<p>At the opening of Parliament in 1843, the House of Lords passed the
usual vote of thanks to the troops which had taken part in the campaign.
A medal was issued to the officers and men who had served in the Chinese
war; leave was granted to the XVIIIth to add to its other battle honours
the word “China” and the device of the Dragon, and Colonel G. Burrell,
Lieutenant-Colonel W. H. Adams, and Majors J. Cowper and J. Grattan
were awarded the C.B.</p>

<p>Very disagreeable orders awaited the regiment on its arrival at Chusan.
Four companies were to remain there as part of its garrison until the Chinese
had fulfilled all the obligations of the treaty, while headquarters and the
greater part of the regiment were to occupy the island of Kulangsu, which
our Government also held as a pledge of Chinese good faith. Kulangsu had
already acquired the reputation of being one of the most unhealthy stations
in China, and the Royal Irish soon discovered that its evil reputation was
but too well deserved. According to Lieutenant-Colonel Graves’s statement,
when the headquarters companies landed they found the detachment of the
regiment which had been there for some months in a deplorable condition.
There had been many deaths among all ranks; every one of the surviving
officers was down with fever,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“and there were not thirty men under command of a sergeant who were
fit for duty or could shoulder a firelock.... When the Headquarter
companies landed from Chusan the men were healthy and well seasoned,
but they very soon began to feel the climate, and before long half the
men were on the sick list, and we began to bury them very fast. I had
been appointed Staff Officer for the island, and at first found much
difficulty in getting coffins quick enough, so I ordered twenty at a time
to be supplied by a contractor at Amoy. Several of our officers died,
and at last I found much difficulty in getting men enough to relieve the
guards. I went to our Colonel, Cowper&mdash;who was the Commandant of
the island&mdash;and represented that if we did not get a ship sent up from
Hong Kong for the invalids we should very soon have no men for guard.
We got a ship and found her of the greatest benefit; she was anchored
half a mile out of the harbour, and the invalids sent on board her came
back in a week fit for duty.</p>

<p>“A large draft joined from England, about three hundred strong,
together with the women and children. This caused a little stir, but it
was a short-lived happiness: they went down almost as fast as we could
provide coffins for them. We pitched tents and moved our camp daily
about the island, but it was no use&mdash;cholera and fever still continued.
The men began to drink to drown dull care; the officers off the sick list
were constantly on Court-Martial duty, and the Colonel received an
official letter from Headquarters drawing his attention to the number of
Courts-Martial for drunkenness, and directing him to parade the regiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
and reprimand the men for their conduct, which was alleged to be the
principal cause of the severe mortality. As Staff Officer and adjutant
of the regiment I was ordered to read this letter to the men, which I
began to do, but I must acknowledge I fairly broke down and had to
hand it to another officer to finish. I felt so keenly how our gallant
poor fellows were being sacrificed, after their long, hard services, to
a climate no one could live in, and <em>how</em> they bore it!”</p></div>

<p>In April 1844, after a hundred and thirty-six officers and men had fallen
victims to the climate of Kulangsu,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> the regiment was reunited at Chusan.
The next station was Hong Kong, where the ordinary routine of garrison
life in the East was suddenly broken by an urgent and wholly unexpected
call to arms. The people of Canton, always overbearing and offensive
towards Europeans, had recently insulted and ill-treated British subjects,
and their Mandarins had refused to make redress for the outrages. The
British Plenipotentiary, Sir John Davis, was a believer in the saying “A word
and a blow, and the blow first,” and he determined to teach the mob of Canton
a lesson they would not soon forget. During the night of the 1st of April,
1847, the Royal Irish, under Lieutenant-Colonel Cowper, with 23 officers and
509 other ranks, and the 42nd regiment of Madras Native Infantry, 399 strong,
were packed into a couple of small men-of-war and an armed steamer. Early
on the following morning the flotilla was off the entrance to the Canton river;
the troops were landed, and driving the Chinese artillerymen from the batteries,
spiked the guns. The works higher up the stream were then treated in the
same way, but not without vigorous opposition from the enemy, whose aim,
however, was much distracted by the steady fire of a party of the Royal Irish,
described in the despatches as the “acting gunners of the XVIIIth, who
replied to the batteries in a style which would have done credit to experienced
artillerymen.” As soon as the ships were off Canton the soldiers occupied the
“factories”; placed them in a state of defence, and made plans for storming
the town. The Royal Irish were looking forward to winning much glory
(and much prize money too!) in the capture of Canton, when the Mandarins,
greatly perturbed by Sir John Davis’s prompt reprisals, hastily made full
atonement for their misdeeds, and the expedition returned to Hong Kong.
They had done a good week’s work: 879 guns, many of great calibre, had been
spiked, much ammunition destroyed, and a greatly needed lesson given to the
Canton roughs&mdash;and all without the loss of a soldier, bluejacket, or marine.</p>

<p>General D’Aguilar, who was in command, mentioned in his despatch the
following officers of the regiment, viz., Lieutenant-Colonel Cowper; Captain
J. Bruce, A.A.G.; Captain Clark Kennedy, Acting A.Q.M.; Captain J. W.
Graves; Captain A. N. Campbell, and Lieutenant E. W. Sargent, Acting
A.D.C.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>Before the troops left Canton the British merchants asked for an officer
to train their newly formed Volunteer corps. Captain J. W. Graves was
selected, and with part of the Light company spent two months in “the
factories,” where between drilling his civilian recruits, drawing up plans for
the defence of the settlement against a sudden rush, and eating the good
dinners to which the merchants invited him, his time was fully occupied.
Soon after this detachment rejoined headquarters the regiment was warned
to prepare to sail for India, and on November 20, 1847, embarked for Bengal
on the transport ship <i>Balcarres</i>. Major W. F. Dillon was in command; with
him were 24 officers, 42 sergeants, 15 drummers, and 595 rank and file, and
when he arrived at Fort William on January 10, 1848, he found awaiting him
drafts from England amounting to 7 officers, 1 drummer, and 334 rank and
file. Thus the XVIIIth began its tour of duty in India with a total strength
of one thousand and eighteen of all ranks.</p>

<span class="fs55">THE SECOND WAR WITH BURMA.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">When the XVIIIth Royal Irish regiment arrived in India the Sikh War
appeared to be over, and all chance of winning fresh laurels seemed relegated
to the distant future. Further troubles, however, broke out in the Punjab,
and for a time the regiment had every hope of again seeing active service
under Sir Hugh Gough, as it was ordered up country and incorporated in the
“Army of Reserve” on its arrival at Umballa in March, 1849. But Gough’s
victory at Goozerat<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> had finally crushed the power of our gallant foes; the
“Army of Reserve” was not called upon to take the field, and the Royal Irish
remained at Umballa till the end of 1849, when they marched to Meerut,
where a draft of two hundred and twenty recruits from home awaited them.
The two flank companies did not accompany headquarters, as in November
they had been sent on an important and interesting duty: they formed the
European portion of the escort selected to guard the Marquis of Dalhousie,
Governor-General of India, in his progress from Rurki to Lahore, the capital
of the great province just added to the British dominions. This detachment
of the XVIIIth was commanded by Captain C. A. Edwards, who in a statement
prepared for this history mentions that as it was feared fanatics would
attempt to murder the Governor-General in his sleep, four picked men of the
Royal Irish at night patrolled the space between the inner and outer walls
of Lord Dalhousie’s tent. These sentries appear to have been abnormally
ceremonious in their manners, for the Governor-General, while warmly
praising their incessant vigilance, said that he had only one fault to find
with them&mdash;they <em>would</em> salute him when he was in his dressing-gown! It
is not clear whether Edwards’ party were present at the historic scene of
Dhuleep Singh’s deposition at Lahore, but they acted nominally as guard of
honour, but virtually as escort to this important prisoner on his journey to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Meerut. In the cold weather of 1850 the regiment was ordered back to
Calcutta; from Allahabad the journey was by river, in flats towed by small
steamers. On its arrival it was quartered in Fort William, where, when all
outlying detachments had been collected, Colonel Reignolds had under his
command a magnificent regiment of eleven hundred and five officers and men.
As it was generally understood that the Royal Irish would be ordered home
in a few months, many officers obtained leave of absence and started for
England under the firm impression that for some time there would be no more
fighting in the East.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> But the truth of the saying “You never know your
luck” has seldom been better illustrated than in the case of the XVIIIth at
the beginning of 1852, when the regiment found itself hurried off to take part
in an expedition to Burma.</p>

<p>The causes of this war, the second which the Burmese had forced upon us
in the course of thirty years, were almost identical with those which had
brought about the conflict with China, described in the <a href="#CHAPTER_V">preceding chapter</a>.
Persistent disregard of treaties and systematic oppression of European traders
had culminated in maltreatment of British subjects so flagrant that our
Government was compelled to seek redress by arms; and in each theatre of
war the prestige of Britain was re-established by the combined efforts of both
branches of the Service. The dissensions between England and the King of
Ava, as the ruler of Burma was officially described, were brought to a climax
by the misconduct of one of his lieutenants, the governor of Rangoon, who
wantonly imprisoned the master of a British ship, and exposed him in the
stocks to the gibes and insults of an Eastern rabble. When a squadron
demanded reparation for this outrage the Burmese temporised, but soon so
clearly showed they did not mean to mend their ways that the commodore
seized a Burmese ship-of-war and blockaded the port of Rangoon. The
truculent governor retaliated by confiscating the property of all British
subjects within his reach; and the sailors thereupon towed their prize to sea
under a heavy fire from the stockades on the banks of the Rangoon river.
When this news reached Calcutta the Indian Government at once ordered a
combined naval and military expedition<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> to rendezvous at the mouth of the
branch of the Irrawaddy on which Rangoon stands, and on January 19, 1852,
Lieutenant-Colonel Reignolds with the headquarters and right wing of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
regiment (444 all told) embarked at Calcutta, followed in a few weeks by
Lieutenant-Colonel C. J. Coote with the left wing, 518 strong.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> This was
not the first time that the sails of a great British expedition had whitened
Burmese waters. In 1824, the King of Ava had invaded the territories of
the East India Company, an act of unprovoked aggression punished by the
capture of Rangoon, and followed by a long series of operations, in which a
very large number of the British troops perished of disease before the
Burmese sued for peace, and ceded to us the provinces of Aracan and
Tenasserim, long narrow strips of territory washed respectively by the waters
of the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean. Rangoon was restored to the
King of Ava, and with it two hundred miles of coast-line that lay like a wedge
between our new dominions.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>In the first phase of the campaign of 1852-53, the operations were chiefly
confined to the capture of important towns near the mouths of the great
rivers which, rising in the Himalayas, flow through the swamps and forests of
Burma on their way to the Indian Ocean. The war-steamers forced their
way up the streams and engaged the stockades and other defences on the
banks; while the soldiers landed, stormed these works, and then, pushing
forward into the jungle, carried the towns by assault. While the operations
were confined to the immediate neighbourhood of rivers and navigable creeks
no question of land transport arose, but when it became necessary to send<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
columns of troops deep into the interior of the country, the innumerable
difficulties of fighting in a pathless and tropical jungle at once made themselves
felt. The ships could indeed bring stores to the point on the river from
which the column struck inland; they could hold a base upon which the
troops could fall back in case of need; but there the power of the navy ceased.
The wants of the soldiers could only be supplied by bullock-carts or elephants,
and the long lines of transport animals had to wind their way through a
densely wooded country, admirably suited to the guerilla tactics of surprises
and ambuscades. Like the Chinese, the Burmans though brave as individuals
were undisciplined as soldiers, and as a rule preferred to fight behind ramparts
to meeting their enemy in the field. In China the garrisons of the cities
waited our attack behind high stone walls; in Burma the defenders of the
towns manned huge timber stockades, in the building of which they were
very skilful. A nation of woodsmen, with their sharp square-pointed swords
they could hew down forest trees and run up timber barricades with extreme
rapidity, and when time was allowed them they could produce really formidable
fortifications, such as those awaiting the British at Rangoon. These
consisted of a substantial rampart, fourteen or fifteen feet high, about twelve
feet wide on the top, and revetted within and without by great teak logs
placed vertically, with the lower ends sunk in the ground. The intervening
space was filled with well-rammed earth. The logs of the outer revetment
stretched up some six feet or more above the level of the parapet, every
fourth or fifth log being cut some three feet shorter than the others to form
loopholes and embrasures. There were many flanking towers; traverses
protected the gates; the ditches were deep, often flooded with water, and
protected by thick abattis. Guns, varying in calibre from 32-prs. to wall
pieces and gingals, were mounted on the parapets. The infantry were armed
with flint-lock muskets, many of them old weapons, worn out and sold as
scrap iron by the British military authorities.</p>

<p>When the ships containing the Bengal contingent reached the mouth of
the Rangoon river on April 2, 1852, Major-General H. Godwin, who was in
command of the troops, sent a vessel under a flag of truce to inquire whether
any answer had been received from the King of Ava to the letter containing
the British demands for redress. The Burmese replied by firing on the flag
of truce, and Godwin, not feeling strong enough to attack Rangoon until the
Madras contingent had joined him, sailed for the capital of Tenasserim,
Moulmein, at that time threatened by the garrison of the neighbouring
Burmese city of Martaban. On the morning of the 5th of April the fleet
opened fire upon Martaban, and under cover of the bombardment the right
wing of the XVIIIth and part of the 80th landed; a storming party, led by
the grenadier companies of these two regiments, scaled the wall, and in a
short time the place was in our hands. Thanks to the diary of the late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Colonel G. A. Elliot, then a subaltern in the Royal Irish, interesting particulars
have been preserved of this little fight, in which the younger men in
the regiment were in action for the first time. Under a heavy but badly
directed fire the grenadiers dashed across the twenty yards of ground between
the water’s edge and the main defence of the city, a thick wall fifteen feet
high and about eight hundred yards in length. Here the enemy’s bullets
began to take effect among the Royal Irish. Colonel Elliot writes that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Private Fergusson received three in his left arm, and died of his
wounds,<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> John Donovan two in his left hand, Coleman one through his
left arm. We ran up and got close under the wall in extended order; the
General was seen to take off his hat and give a cheer, which our men
returned and then quickly sprung up the wall, (which was overgrown
with shrubs) and rushed upon the Burmese, who quickly retired to some
jungle, whence they fired, though without much effect. While surmounting
the wall one of our officers noticed a man in the regiment get on to
the top and look intently into a large bush below him. Still gazing
intently, he loosed a brick, flung it down into the bush, raised his musket
and shot a Burmese who had been hiding there in cover. We then
advanced, and joining part of the 80th, and one of our own companies,
skirmished up one of the hills enclosed by the wall, driving the Burmese
before us, and charging them whenever they appeared in numbers. The
hill was very steep, and obstacles existed in the shape of felled trees
with branches pointing downwards. At the top was a Pagoda, surrounded
by a wall mounted with gingals, but as there was no resistance,
the men rested here for an hour in the shade. We then moved down a
lane which led towards the next hill; after advancing about two hundred
yards we came to an open space where the bullets began to fly over our
heads from the hill in front. The men halted, and Lieutenant-Colonel
Reignolds, XVIIIth, who was acting Brigadier, halted for reinforcements: ... but
as soon as the Burmese saw that we had stopped, they began
shouting and challenging us to come on, and after a while they poured
down the hill towards us. Colonel Reignolds now allowed the men to
charge, and with a cheer they dashed forward. The enemy ran back
to a wall on the top of the hill and began a badly aimed fire; Glesson,
Grenadier Company was struck in the mouth. The enemy evacuated
the hill.”</p></div>

<p>After clearing a third hill the detachment whose fortunes Elliot has
described joined the main body, and as the enemy were completely routed all
marched back to the beach. The casualties in this affair were eight wounded,
seven of whom were men of the Royal Irish; but many soldiers were struck
down by the sun, a warning, unhappily disregarded, against the folly of
wearing in the tropics the same uniform as that in use in the United
Kingdom. In the despatch describing the capture of Martaban the following
officers of the regiment were mentioned, viz., Lieutenant-Colonel Reignolds;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Captain A. N. Campbell, on whom devolved the command of the wing when
Reignolds was ordered to act as Brigadier; and Captain A. Gillespie, grenadier
company, who was the first man over the enemy’s fortifications.</p>

<p>Godwin had now secured the safety of Moulmein; and leaving a small
garrison in Martaban, he returned with the greater part of his force to the
Rangoon river, where the Madras contingent and reinforcements from Bengal
awaited him. Among the latter was the left wing of the Royal Irish, who
since its arrival had been employed with the Navy in destroying the
stockades at the mouth of the river. On the 10th of April the fleet began
to move up-stream, and next morning the steamers were in their appointed
positions, ready to bombard the works which defended the landing-places
giving access to Rangoon. The Burmese opened fire; the sailors replied with
energy, and the cannonade continued till late in the day, when landing
parties, among whom were detachments of the XVIIIth, stormed the
stockades; and driving away the enemy, cleared the way for the disembarkation
of the main body. Though General Godwin had served in the first
expedition to Burma, his recollections of the topography of Rangoon would
have been misleading had they not been supplemented by information supplied
by a British trader, from whom he learned that since the war of
1824-26 part of the town had been abandoned and lay in ruins; a new
quarter had sprung up, and the fortifications had been remodelled to meet the
fresh conditions. Rangoon was now built in a rough square, with sides about
three-quarters of a mile in length, surrounded by deep ditches, and walls
sixteen feet high and eight feet thick. In the works was included the Shwe
Dagon, turned into a citadel by the mounting of cannon upon the three tiers
of huge terraces which support the foundations of this great pagoda. From
the landing-places on the river to the gate in the southern wall is about
a mile and a quarter; and the Burmese, remembering that in the first war
we had marched by that road, concluded that the tactics of 1826 would be
repeated in 1852, and concentrated the greater part of their artillery and
about ten thousand troops on the southern section of the defences. Godwin,
however, completely upset this scheme of defence by declining to attack
where he was so obviously expected.</p>

<p>Early on the 12th of April the right column&mdash;composed of the XVIIIth,
51st, the 40th Bengal Native Infantry, two guns of the Madras Artillery, and
a detachment of the Madras Sappers and Miners&mdash;landed, with a day’s cooked
rations and sixty rounds of ammunition on their persons; by 7 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span> they were
advancing on an outwork, known as the “White House stockade,” which
obstructed their path through the jungle. The field-guns, escorted by the
grenadier and Light companies of the XVIIIth, shelled it till the 51st were
ordered to the assault; the other companies of the regiment were following in
support, when they were suddenly ordered to halt, and to crowd into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
jungle to clear the track for the Madras Sappers and the parties of bluejackets
and European soldiers who carried the scaling ladders, then urgently
required at the front. Some of the Royal Irish had been detailed for this
duty, which proved a dangerous one, as out of the four men of the regiment
told off to the first ladder three were wounded. This delay threw the Royal
Irish “out of the hunt,” and by the time they reached the stockade the 51st
had stormed and occupied it. At this point General Godwin was forced
to call a halt: five of the senior officers had been struck down by solar
apoplexy, two of them fatally; many of the men lay on the ground senseless
from sunstroke; all ranks were worn out by the overpowering heat, and he
was forced to bivouac on the ground he had gained. From papers left by
Colonel, then Lieutenant, C. Woodwright, XVIIIth, it appears that during the
afternoon, while the Royal Irish were slaking their thirst at wells discovered
in the jungle, a number of Burmese stalked the covering parties, surprised
them by a heavy fire, and occupied a pagoda, from which they directed
an annoying fusilade on the watering-place. While other portions of the
regiment drove back the enemy’s skirmishers, Woodwright’s company was
ordered to seize the pagoda: this was accomplished successfully, though
with the loss of Colour-Sergeant Kelly and several men seriously wounded.
Twice in the night the Burmese attempted to rush the bivouac of the Royal
Irish, but were driven back by a few rounds of canister from light field-guns.</p>

<p>For more than forty hours General Godwin was unable to advance. His
commissariat officers were very slow in issuing rations to replace the one-day’s
supply carried by the troops; the gunners were equally slow in landing
and transporting to the front the four 8-in. howitzers, on which he relied to
make a breach in the defences of Rangoon; and it was not until 5 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span> on the
14th that the column was again in motion. The XVIIIth and the 40th
Bengal Native Infantry led, followed by the 51st and the 35th Madras Native
Infantry; the 80th were in charge of the guns, and a Madras Native Infantry
regiment kept up communication with the ships in the river. Working
slowly through jungle so thick that paths had to be cut for the passage
of the guns, Godwin avoided the enemy’s main stockades; but as his leading
troops came within sight of the great pagoda, the guns on its terraces opened
fire. Opposite the gate in the eastern wall, by which he proposed to force his
way into Rangoon, the ground was so difficult that there was barely room
for the XVIIIth and the 80th to form up in quarter columns, while they
halted till the guns had made a practicable breach. The Burmese artillery
played upon the easy target offered to them, and their skirmishers became so
bold that five hundred muskets were required to keep them at a respectful
distance from the main body of the infantry. The situation was becoming
impossible when it was discovered that the gate had been opened, presumably
to afford a safe retreat to the Burmese soldiers who were harassing our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
flanks. Godwin determined to assault forthwith, and placed Lieutenant-Colonel
Coote in command of a storming party, composed of two companies of
the Royal Irish, the wing of the 80th, and part of the 40th B.N.I. Under
a galling fire, the column moved with great steadiness across a shallow
valley, half a mile in width, and swept like a tidal wave over terrace after
terrace until the Shwe Dagon was won. Then the Burmese broke and fled in
panic, losing heavily in their retreat, especially at a point where part of the
grenadier company of the Royal Irish fell upon them in flank with the
bayonet, and in a short time Rangoon was in our hands. In the British
land forces the casualties between the 11th and the 14th of April were
a hundred and forty-five&mdash;two officers were killed and fourteen wounded;
fifteen of the other ranks were killed, and a hundred and fourteen wounded.
Nearly a third of these losses fell upon the Royal Irish: Lieutenant and
Adjutant R. Doran, pierced by four bullets, fell mortally wounded at the foot
of the pagoda;<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> Lieutenant-Colonel Coote, Captain W. T. Bruce, and Lieutenant
G. A. Elliot were wounded; a sergeant and two privates were killed,
a sergeant, a drummer, and thirty-seven privates wounded.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> In his despatch
General Godwin mentions four officers of the Royal Irish&mdash;Lieutenant-Colonel
Reignolds, who was in temporary command of a brigade, Lieutenant-Colonel
Coote, Captain G. F. S. Call (Brigade Major), and Captain J. J. Wood,
who brought the regiment out of action.</p>

<p>For the next few months the XVIIIth lay sweltering at Rangoon, where
General Godwin was obliged to await the arrival of reinforcements before
undertaking further operations on a large scale. During this period of
enforced inaction life was by no means agreeable: the heat was intense, the
labour of hut-building severe, the duties heavy, and there was much sickness
among the troops. Two small expeditions pushed out north and west&mdash;the
first occupied the town of Pegu; the second captured the city of Bassein,
important as commanding one of the three navigable mouths of the Irrawaddy.
In neither of these enterprises did the Royal Irish play any part.
Their only “outing” at this time seems to have been a two-days’ hunt after a
Burmese official whom the General was anxious to take prisoner. After hard
marching they had their quarry almost within their grasp, when he disappeared
into the jungle, leaving in their hands a string of carts laden
with his numerous wives. In August it became known that the King of
Ava, by no means disheartened by the loss of Rangoon and the other
towns we had wrested from him, was gathering large forces near Prome,
two hundred miles up the Irrawaddy. After a flotilla of gunboats had
destroyed the stockades on the banks of the river near that town, Godwin
determined to occupy it, to serve as an advanced base in the movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
upon Ava, which he awaited the permission of Government to begin.
When the long-expected reinforcements began to arrive, the Royal Irish
found themselves in a division commanded by Sir John Cheape. The
first brigade was under Lieutenant-Colonel Reignolds, and consisted of the
XVIIIth, and the 40th and 67th Native Infantry regiments. Two officers
of the Royal Irish were on the staff: Captain G. F. S. Call was Brigade
Major to Reignolds’ brigade, Captain W. T. Bruce was Assistant Adjutant-General
to the first division. This organisation, however, appears to have
been merely one on paper, for in September Godwin announced to the troops
that he was about to resume active operations, and warned the XVIIIth, the
80th, and the 35th Madras Native Infantry to hold themselves in readiness
to embark under command of Brigadier-General Reignolds. These
regiments, with some Artillery and Sappers and Miners, disembarked with
slight opposition at Prome on the 9th of October, and on marching a short
way inland found that the Burmese had disappeared. In the landing there
were a few casualties, none of them among the Royal Irish; but that night
the young soldiers of the regiment had a stern lesson in outpost duty&mdash;one
of their comrades, who allowed himself to be surprised on sentry, was
killed, and his head sent as a trophy to the King of Ava. While troops
were being gradually passed up the river to Prome, the Burmese attacked
our garrison in Pegu, and a considerable force had to be sent to the rescue,
but the XVIIIth was not employed either in the relief of Pegu, or in the
operations of a column sent to clear the jungles round Martaban.</p>

<p>For many months it continued to form part of the garrison of
Prome, which was invested by the Burmese, who surrounded the place
with stockades, thrown up in the jungle, a mile or two beyond our
outposts. In November three companies helped to destroy one of these
works, whose defenders had been active in intercepting supplies brought in
by friendly natives. Later in the month two companies under Brevet-Major
Edwards were sent on a much longer expedition; they formed the British
contingent in a small column sent to rid the districts of Khangheim and
Padaung of the enemy. Crossing to the right bank they worked up-stream,
and at first met with little opposition, though they were “sniped at” by
night. “On one occasion the watering-place was surrounded by a small
party, and several sepoys who had gone there to fill their drinking-vessels
were killed or wounded. The column passed the spot where a few days
before the Captain of a native regiment with a small body of his men was
surprised by the Burmese, and the place where they were beheaded was still
plainly discernible by the blood-stains on the stones. The heads of the
Captain and two men had been sent to Ava; their bodies were left on the
banks of the river till buried by the English.”<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> The senior officer of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
column broke down in health; Edwards succeeded to the command; and
from the Digest of Service it appears that after several successful skirmishes
he drove the Burmese into a place called Tomah, where he hemmed them
in until March, 1853, when reinforcements of all arms enabled him to storm
their stockade, and capture their guns, stores, and bullock-carts. During a
lull in these operations Major Edwards was sent on a difficult, but interesting
piece of work&mdash;to lead a small column to the top of the Tonghoo pass over
the Yo-Ma range of mountains between Burma and Aracan, and there take
charge of a hundred and forty-eight elephants, sent from India by the
Governor-General to reinforce the transport of the army. Edwards’ command
was composed of a hundred of the XVIIIth under Major Borrow, the
same number of the 80th, two hundred Sikhs, and a few Madras Sappers
and Miners, with three thousand coolies to carry the supplies and drive the
slaughter cattle. All went well till the column began to ascend the foothills
of the main range, when the coolies, frightened at the steep, jungle-covered
slopes, flung down their loads and deserted in a body. As the European
troops could carry but a portion of the stores, they soon ran out of tea,
biscuit, and spirits, and had to fall back upon beef-on-the-hoof, and for many
days had nothing to eat but meat; to the Sikhs, whose religion debared
them from animal food, a small quantity of grain was supplied. A day or
two after this breakdown of the transport the guides confessed that they
had lost their way, so Edwards decided to work upwards, along the course of
the streams that furrowed the mountain-side. Slowly but sturdily the troops
breasted the hills; by day they hacked paths through the jungle; by night
they slept in clothing soaked in many fords and torrents. Yet such was
the stamina of the Europeans that during the expedition not one fell ill, and
they outmarched the Sikhs, who broke down and had to be left behind.
After nineteen days of this tremendous strain Edwards reached the rendezvous;
the elephants had not yet come up, but a large supply of rice
had already arrived, and his troops, eager for vegetable food, pounced on it
with delight. In a few days the elephants lumbered up the pass, loaded with
commissariat stores of every kind, on which the men feasted, while the
animals rested after their climb. Then the long column of men and beasts
crashed downwards through the forest and reached Padaung, on the Irrawaddy,
in less than a quarter of the time occupied in the upward march.
Official thanks were given to all ranks when the convoy of elephants was
handed over to the transport department, and a month’s extra batta was
granted to those who had taken part in the expedition.</p>

<p>The account of the doings of the XVIIIth at the front must now be
broken by Lord Wolseley’s description of his first meeting with the regiment
of which he is now the honoured Colonel-in-Chief. As a callow
subaltern in the 80th, quite new to the practical side of war, he found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
himself at Rangoon in charge of a piquet, composed in part of very young
soldiers of the XVIIIth, who had been left at the base under command of
Brevet-Lieutenant-Colonel Grattan. These youngsters were not yet disciplined;
they had been greatly amused at the young officer’s attempts to
march his detachment to its post, and three of them, carried away by their
high spirits, took liberties and refused to number off in the way he ordered.
Wolseley promptly made prisoners of the culprits, and next morning</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“had to appear at the Orderly Room of the Royal Irish detachment. It
was a little room in a small teak-built hut, and there Colonel Grattan,
C.B., of that historic regiment, daily dispensed justice to his young
recruits. He was an old and amusing Irishman, full of quaint stories,
and a very pleasant companion. Taken prisoner in the China War,
he had been carried about in a cage as a show for the amusement of
millions who had never before seen a European. His smiling face and
grotesque grimaces always obtained for him a favourable reception. He
greeted me pleasantly when I entered the orderly room, where&mdash;I may
explain for Civilian readers&mdash;the Commanding Officer of every regiment
and battalion in the Army holds a daily court to administer justice all
round. Three prisoners from Tipperary were marched in bare-headed,
and were drawn up facing the Colonel, who sat, pen in hand, behind a
little table which separated them from him. A Corporal and a file of
the guard, with drawn bayonets, stood beside the culprits, an acting
Sergeant-Major, standing as all the others were, at ‘Attention’, made
up the stage. A solemn silence that somewhat awed me pervaded the
scene, and my shyness became greater when the funny-looking colonel
addressing me, asked me sternly what complaint I had to make against
the prisoners. I told my story as best I could, being extremely impressed
by what I believed to be the gravity of the offence. My military reading
and study of the Mutiny Act and Articles of War had led me to believe
that, next to striking an officer or running away in battle, these prisoners
had committed the most heinous offence in absolutely refusing to obey
a lawful command when on outpost duty before the enemy. I expected
they would be at once sent to trial before a general court martial, and
either sentenced to death, or if their lives were spared in consideration of
their youth and entire ignorance of a soldier’s duty, they would at least
be transported.</p>

<p>“When I had finished my awful indictment, the Colonel with his
funny little grey eyes, frowned from under his long grey eyebrows,
first at me and then in sternness at the boy prisoners before him. There
was an awful pause; you could have heard a pin drop if any one there
had had such an evidence of civilization ready for the occasion. I
held my breath, not knowing what was coming. I looked at the
Sergeant-Major; his face was wooden and devoid of all expression as
he stolidly looked straight before him into nothing. In a moment a
volley of oaths from the Colonel removed the atmospheric pressure. He
called the prisoners ‘limbs of Satan,’ and choking, partly at least I should
say because his vituperative vocabulary had come to an end, he jumped
to his feet, upsetting the table, with its ink bottle, papers, etc., and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
rushed upon the prisoners, kicking hard at the nearest, and crying aloud:
‘Get out, ye blackguards; never let me see you again.’ Whether it was
that the prisoners were accustomed to this mode of justice and, being
frightened, were anxious to avoid the toes of their Colonel’s boots as
he lashed out at them or not, they turned round and ran for their lives,
the Sergeant-Major after them, with their caps, which he had been
holding&mdash;according to regulation&mdash;whilst this strangely scenic trial was
being enacted.</p>

<p>“I was in dismay, and for a moment thought of running too, but
seeing the old Colonel burst out laughing, I tried to smile, but it was
an unhealthy attempt at hilarity on my part. However, being assured
the men would never forget the scene or misbehave again, I went
away feeling rather that I had been the culprit, and had only escaped
condign punishment through consideration of my youth and complete
ignorance of all military customs and laws. I don’t know whether
these three boys from Tipperary retained a lasting remembrance&mdash;as
I did&mdash;of the curious mode of administering justice, but I am sure
their Colonel’s conduct was far more in consonance with their views
of propriety, and far better suited to the case, than any sentence of
imprisonment and trial by court martial would have been. I laugh
now as I think of the whole scene, and as I do so, I feel all the more
how necessary it is that Irish soldiers should have Irish officers over
them, who understand their curiously Eastern character, and who are
consequently better able to deal with them than strangers can.”<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p></div>

<p>Until the middle of February, 1853, the headquarter companies at Prome
had a weary time. Sickness was rampant; in a letter written at the end
of November, 1852, an officer of the XVIIIth mentions that the regiment
could only turn out 350 men fit to take the field. Ninety men had been
buried at Rangoon, where cholera broke out a few hours after the capture
of the great Pagoda; for a month the Royal Irish had been dying at the
rate of almost one a day; 137 were in hospital; large numbers had broken
down and been invalided out of the country. The other regiments were
equally unhealthy, and out of the whole garrison of Prome the General
could only count on some 900 effectives, whose numbers were daily reduced
by the ravages of climate and by the strain of the guards and piquets,
which, though cut down as low as safety permitted, told severely upon the
troops who remained at duty. The only break in this harassing and
monotonous existence was afforded by occasional reconnaissances and night
attacks, in which the enemy showed themselves more anxious to murder
and decapitate individual men than to close with any formed body of
soldiers. Suddenly four companies of the Royal Irish were warned for
an expedition to clear the line of communication, which was harassed by
Myat Toon, a robber chieftain, who from his lair near Donobyu attacked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
the native boats in our employ on their way up the Irrawaddy with
provisions for the front. The village of Donobyu was about fifty miles
above Rangoon; it was connected with the Irrawaddy by a network of
creeks, and surrounded by dense jungle, almost impassable from deep nullahs
full of water, which cut up the ground in every direction. In this jungle
Myat Toon had fortified many positions, formidable in themselves, and
most difficult of access to Europeans. The sailors had made several spirited
attempts to penetrate into this labyrinth, but their boats were unable to
pass the barricades of logs and forest trees with which the waterways had
been obstructed; and a combined force of bluejackets and soldiers, acting
on land under a post-captain in the navy, was surprised and defeated
with the loss of two guns. The army was now to take in hand the
punishment of the seven or eight thousand guerillas who followed the
fortunes of Myat Toon, and General Godwin selected Sir John Cheape to
lead the avenging force, composed of a small body of Irregular Native
cavalry, detachments of Madras Sappers and Madras and Bengal Artillery
with one 24-pr. howitzer and a 9-pr. field-gun, two hundred of the XVIIIth
under Captain A. W. F. S. Armstrong,<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> two hundred of the 51st, two hundred
Sikhs, and the 67th Bengal Native Infantry regiment. Major F. Wigston,
XVIIIth, was in charge of the right wing of the column, with Lieutenant
F. Eteson, XVIIIth, as his staff-officer. Descending the river to within
thirty-five miles of Donobyu, Cheape disembarked at Henzada, a village
where a number of country bullock-carts awaited him. As he was led to
believe that three or four days’ march would bring him to Myat Toon’s
stockades, he decided to fill up his transport with seven or eight days’
rations, dash on his enemy, defeat him, and then hasten back to the steamers.
Leaving behind him the sick, who, though it was barely a week since he
left Prome, were already numerous, he plunged into an unknown country,
where his guides proved useless, his information defective and misleading.
He could not find the main body of Myat Toon’s men, though skirmishing
dacoits hung on his flanks, and in four days he was obliged to fall back
to the river for supplies. He now transferred his base to Donobyu, which
was known to have been evacuated by the enemy, and sending his empty
carts there by land under escort of a party of the XVIIIth, he re-embarked
with the remainder of his troops for Donobyu, where he remained till the
7th of March, when the native regiment joined him, and with it a draft
of recruits for the 80th and a large supply of commissariat stores. After
providing for the safety of his base and of another batch of sick men,
General Cheape started on his second hunt for Myat Toon, whose entrenchments
he was again assured could be reached in three days. Now began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
a campaign, short in duration, but harassing beyond measure to the troops
engaged in it. The soldiers had to feel their way along narrow paths,
often obstructed by trees cut down across the track by foes, who rarely
showed themselves by day, though they disturbed the bivouac by sniping
shots at night. To bridge the nullahs took much time and labour; the
burden of guarding the transport carts was heavy; the heat was steamy,
exhausting, and depressing; fog hung over the face of the land until
several hours after sunrise; the water was tainted, and cholera broke out
among the men. Then rations began to run short, and the column was
obliged to halt four days in this pestilential forest while a convoy brought
up fresh supplies from Donobyu. After forming an advance base for his
spare stores and the sick and wounded, Cheape once more pushed forward,
and on the 17th the right wing came upon traces of the enemy, who had
blocked the track with a series of abattis and recently felled trees. The
Royal Irish were leading, for Wigston, remembering that it was St Patrick’s
Day and anxious to do honour to the occasion, had detailed them as advance-guard
to give them every chance of a fight, if the Burmese would so far
oblige them. After they had turned these obstacles, or cut their way
through them, they ran against a stockade held by Myat Toon’s followers,
and with a wild yell dashed at the work, which with the help of the
Sikhs they carried “most gallantly” at the point of the bayonet.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> The
defenders did not wait for the cold steel, but after firing up to the last
moment bolted into the jungle. One man, however, lingered too long
over his parting shot, and was pursued by two subalterns, Hewitt and
Eteson, who gave chase down the bed of a dry watercourse. Hewitt slipped
and fell; Eteson succeeded in running his quarry down, and was rewarded
by obtaining from his prisoner much useful information about the enemy’s
main position. In this little affair Lieutenant Woodwright and five rank
and file were wounded. Next day there was sharp skirmishing before
the approach of darkness forced Cheape to halt on a narrow path, leading
towards the village reported to be the headquarters of Myat Toon. Very
soon after the piquets had been posted and the bivouac formed, the fog
fell so heavily as to render reconnaissance very difficult, but when the
outposts reported that the enemy was busy felling trees and completing
the defences of his position, Lieutenant Eteson, three officers of the Sikhs,
and three Sepoys stole forward, ascertained where the enemy was at work,
and then returning to the General, described the place with sufficient accuracy
to enable the gunners to fire rockets at it with some effect.</p>

<p>At the first glimmer of dawn on the 19th of March, our scouts began to
grope their way down a wet nullah close to the bivouac, and followed it to its
junction with a large creek, where the sound of voices warned them that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Burmese were at hand. Creeping from tree to tree, the reconnoitrers reached
the edge of the creek, and peering through the gloom dimly discerned Myat
Toon’s works on the farther bank. The position was a strong one: the creek
served as a moat to a line of cleverly built breastworks, well loopholed, and
protected by abattis; the left rested on an impassable swamp; the right ended
in a dense thicket. As far as the scouts could see, the enemy’s front was
about a quarter of a mile long; but its prolongations into the jungle really
gave it a length of twelve hundred yards. Cheape would gladly have turned
the enemy’s right by a flank march; but to do so he would have had to cut
a road through thick jungle, and the condition of the troops precluded his
imposing so heavy a task upon them, for though their spirit was high, their
bodies were enfeebled by the effect of scanty food and bad water, while their
numbers had been much reduced by the ravages of dysentery and cholera.
There was nothing for it but a frontal attack; slowly and in silence he
moved towards the creek, and then under cover of the fog marched along
its bank within a hundred yards of the Burmese stockades. For a time this
processional movement was not discovered, for Myat Toon, convinced that the
British would not leave their bivouac till the sun had dispelled the fog, had
taken no precautions against surprise; then suddenly a rolling fire burst from
the whole face of the works; to meet it, the Sikhs were extended along our
bank of the nullah, while the remainder of the troops fell back into the jungle
to form for battle. Thus began an engagement as confused as the ground on
which it was fought. At first a musketry duel raged across the creek; then
scouting parties, or, as we should now call them, battle patrols, ascertained
that opposite the enemy’s right of the line of stockades the creek ran dry, and
was crossed by a track, which proved to have been prepared for defence: large
forest trees had been felled across it; it was swept with grape from the two
guns captured from the navy, flanked by a detached work, and pitted with
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">trous-de-loup</i>. A storming party was hastily organised; and the detachment
of the 80th attempted to force its way across to the other side of the creek,
but being inadequately supported, failed in its object. Then the Royal Irish
and the Sikhs tried to push through the dense belt of jungle on the right of
the Burmese line, but could not pass the abattis and detached breastworks
hidden in its thickets. Finally, the General decided that at all costs the track
must be won and the stockades near it carried at the point of the bayonet.
The troops, as may well be imagined, were by this time greatly scattered, and
while the buglers were rallying the infantry, the Bengal artillerymen, with
the help of stragglers from the British detachments, dragged their 24-pr.
howitzer into action only twenty-five yards from the enemy, and covered the
concentration of the foot soldiers by a destructive storm of canister. In this
episode Private &mdash;&mdash; Connors, Royal Irish, greatly distinguished himself. Early
in the fight a Burmese bullet had broken his left arm; he made his way to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the doctor, had the broken limb temporarily bound up, and then under heavy
fire helped to run the howitzer up to the front, tugging at the spokes of a
wheel with his right arm. At length a number of men from the XVIIIth,
51st, and 80th were collected, and, guided by Ensign Wolseley, charged down
the track yelling at their enemies, who manned the parapets and shouted
defiantly, “Come on, Come on!” to them in Burmese. This is not the place to
describe how Wolseley led his mixed command, nor how he was struck down,
hard hit, at the moment of victory; his personal adventures in this charge, the
second he led during the engagement, are narrated in the first volume of his
Autobiography. It is enough to say that the troops advanced with determination,
swept over the works, and killed and wounded large numbers of the
four thousand men opposed to them. Those of the Royal Irish who took part
in the final rush were well to the front: Lieutenant W. P. Cockburn fell
desperately wounded as he scaled a stockade; Lieutenant Eteson was one of
the first into the main work; and a party, led by Lieutenant Woodwright,
recaptured the two naval guns, and marked the number of the regiment upon
them with a rusty nail.</p>

<p>Cheape’s success would have been complete if he had been able to secure
Myat Toon; but the Chief escaped with his life, though with little else, for he
was compelled to abandon all his supplies and munitions of war. To follow
him farther into the jungle was impossible, for the health of the column was
so bad that the General was obliged to return to Donobyu, and thence to
Prome where his steamers anchored on April 2. The operations against
Myat Toon had been costly; the losses in action were one hundred and thirty,
while cholera alone caused more than a hundred deaths. Most of the
casualties occurred on the 19th of March, when eleven men were killed and
eighty-four officers and men wounded. In the Royal Irish regiment Lieutenant
W. F. Cockburn died of his injuries; Major F. Wigston was severely
wounded; a corporal and eight men were killed; a sergeant and twenty-six
men wounded; three colour-sergeants and eleven men died of cholera;<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> and
the health of the whole detachment was so much affected that on landing at
Prome only twenty-two officers and men remained fit for duty. Major
F. Wigston, Captain A. W. F. S. Armstrong, and Captain W. T. Bruce were
mentioned in despatches.</p>

<p>The regiment was not again in action during the Burmese war, as negotiations
for peace put a stop to all further operations in the field. The
province of Pegu was annexed to England, and as soon as the new territory
settled down, the XVIIIth was ordered to Calcutta, arrived there at the end
of November 1853, and a few weeks later embarked for home.</p>

<p>In recognition of their services Majors F. Wigston and C. A. Edwards

W. T. Bruce brevet majorities. A medal and clasp was issued to all ranks,
and the word “Pegu” was added to the battle honours of the regiment. The
losses of the Royal Irish in this campaign were enormous. When they
returned to India their roll had been reduced by three hundred and sixty-five
officers and men, of whom but few had been killed in action or died of wounds;

<span class="fs55">THE WAR IN THE CRIMEA.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">When the Royal Irish reached England in June, 1854, after a six months’
voyage from Calcutta, they were greeted by the news that for the first time
since Waterloo Britain had become embroiled in a European war, and in
alliance with France had sent troops to protect Turkey against the Russians,
who had invaded the part of the Sultan’s dominions then known as the
Danubian principalities. The Czar had long cast covetous eyes on Turkey,
whose European provinces on the Ægean and the Sea of Marmora prevented
the expansion of Russia towards the Mediterranean, and thus limited her
seaboard to the Baltic and the Black Sea. In the middle of the nineteenth
century Turkey appeared to be so decadent a country that its ruler was
commonly described as “the sick man”; the Czar actually threw out suggestions
to England that she should divide with him “the sick man’s heritage,”
and on her indignant refusal he determined to bide his time and pick a
quarrel with the Sultan on the first opportunity. A pretext soon presented
itself in a dispute between the Greek and Latin branches of the Christian
faith concerning their respective rights in the Holy Places of Jerusalem: the
Czar hotly espoused the cause of the Greek Church, while the Emperor
Napoleon III., reviving the historic claim of France to represent the Latin
Church in Palestine, vigorously supported the views of the Roman Catholics.
The Sultan, profoundly indifferent to the rivalries of those whom his religion
taught him to regard as infidel dogs, attempted to propitiate both sides, but
with such conspicuous ill-success that the Czar declared war against him in
October, 1853, and invaded the Turkish provinces on the Danube. To defend
Turkey against this wanton and unprovoked attack, England and France in
the spring of 1854 landed a considerable number of troops at Varna, a
Bulgarian port on the Black Sea. It was from no love of the Turks that
England thus plunged into war with Russia: she took up arms in pursuance
of the foreign policy which for centuries she has followed on the Continent,
and sided with the weaker state&mdash;not on altruistic grounds but solely to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
preserve the balance of power in Europe, and to prevent the Czar from
possessing himself of Constantinople, and thus obtaining direct access to the
Mediterranean Sea.</p>

<p>The Anglo-French troops were still at Varna when, in the interests of
peace, Austria brought such pressure upon the Czar that he recalled his
armies from Turkish soil. But though the immediate danger to Constantinople
was averted by this intervention, the governments of England and
France agreed that there would be no safety for Turkey, and therefore no
tranquillity in European politics, until the Russian fleet in the Black Sea had
been captured or destroyed, and its base at Sebastopol levelled to the ground.
When the demolition of this great naval station was thus determined on, the
allies knew little of Sebastopol,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> except that it was a fortress in the south of
the Crimea, a peninsula jutting into the Black Sea from the mainland of
Russia: and no soldier in western Europe had any conception of the difficulties
awaiting the Anglo-French Expedition when it put to sea from Varna on
September 7, 1854. Exclusive of the crews of the great fleet of warships by
which the transports were escorted, the fighting men numbered about 63,000,
of whom 28,000 were French, 7000 Turks, and 28,000 British. The French
were under Marshal St Arnaud; Lord Raglan, who had served on Wellington’s
staff in the Peninsular war, commanded the British troops. Neither of these
officers lived to see the end of the campaign: St Arnaud died in September,
1854, and was succeeded by General Canrobert who, after a few months,
resigned his post to General Pélissier: Lord Raglan fell a victim to cholera at
the end of June, 1855, and was replaced by General Simpson. The Turks
were commanded by Omar Pasha.</p>

<p>The effort to collect and equip for war the comparatively small body of
men forming the British quota of the combined forces had greatly taxed the
military resources of England. After the fall of the great Napoleon had
restored peace to Europe, enormous reductions had been made in our military
expenditure;<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> not only was the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">personnel</i> of the army cut down, but the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matériel</i> was allowed to fall into decay. For more than thirty years every
arm and every department of the service was systematically starved, with
results well summed up by Lord Palmerston, who in 1846 bluntly informed
his colleagues in the Cabinet that our military weakness was such that
England existed “only by sufferance and by the forbearance of other Powers.”
This opinion was endorsed by the highest authority in the British army, for
Wellington himself acknowledged that our supply of guns, arms, ammunition,
and all kinds of stores was inadequate. Nor were these grievous shortcomings
atoned for by any high standard of efficiency amongst the troops,
for though the drill and discipline of the army were alike excellent, neither
the soldiers nor the departments vital to their existence in the field were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
trained in the slightest degree for active service; indeed, until 1853, when a
few thousand men spent some weeks under canvas, no camp of exercise had
been formed in England since the end of the Great War with France. Marksmanship
was almost a lost art; and although the deadly volleys of the
British infantry in the Peninsula had won for our troops the reputation of
the best shots in Europe, musketry was so entirely neglected during the
dead period after Waterloo, that the injunction “Fire low, and hit ’em in the
legs, boys,” was the only instruction given to recruits. Even in the Foot
Guards the men were considered to be masters of their weapon if, once in
every three years, they fired thirty rounds of ball cartridge. The military
education of the officers was no better than that of the rank and file; there
was no attempt to teach them anything beyond barrack-square drill; the
vast majority grew up ignorant of every detail of their profession, and as the
Staff College at Camberley was not then in existence, the officers selected for
employment on the staff proved in the majority of cases to be blind leaders
of the blind. The few veterans of the Peninsula who were still to be
found among the Generals had seen war on a grand scale; the officers who
had served in eastern and colonial campaigns had acquired much useful
knowledge in these distant operations, but with these exceptions the Staff
and regimental officers were as untrained in the practice, as they were
unversed in the theory of war.</p>

<p>When the Royal Irish reached England they were quartered at Chatham
and Canterbury. At first there seemed no likelihood of their being actively
employed, for when the regiment had left India many men had volunteered into
other corps, and the climate of Burma had told so heavily on those who still
remained with the Colours that a large number of them were unfit for active
service. Fortune, however, befriended the XVIIIth; in October the flank
companies under Brevet-Lieutenant-Colonel Edwards were ordered to Windsor,
to strengthen the militia battalion which had replaced the regiment of Foot
Guards at the Royal Castle. Her Majesty, Queen Victoria was much impressed
by the bronzed and soldierly appearance of the detachment, and
learning from Colonel Edwards that the regiment was most anxious to serve
in the war, she was pleased to direct that the XVIIIth should proceed forthwith
to the Crimea, where reinforcements were urgently required. As the
result of the medical examination proved that less than four hundred men
were fit for the campaign, volunteers were invited from other regiments: four
hundred joined from the 94th, a hundred and fifty from the 51st, and smaller
contingents from other corps. On December 8, 1854, the regiment, eight
hundred and forty-eight strong,<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> embarked at Portsmouth in the s.s. <i>Magdalene</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
and reached the Crimea at the end of the year, about three months and
a half after the Allies had made good their footing on Russian soil.</p>

<p>To enable the reader to understand the condition of the British Expeditionary
Force when the <i>Magdalene</i> steamed into the harbour of Balaclava, it
is necessary to give a very short account of the main events of the war up to
the end of 1854. Between the 14th and 18th of September the Allies<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> were
engaged in landing at Kalamita Bay, about thirty miles north of Sebastopol;
two days after their disembarkation was completed they forced the passage
of the river Alma, defeating the Russians so completely that they were
allowed to march southward without molestation, and to form bases on the
coast within a few miles of Sebastopol, the British establishing themselves at
Balaclava, a little port eight miles to the south, the French at Kamiesch Bay,
six miles to the south-west of the fortress. The Russian stronghold lies on
the shores of a harbour, in shape not unlike a T: the top of the letter is
represented by an arm of the sea running eastward from the Euxine for
about four miles, and varying in width from a thousand to twelve hundred
yards, while the leg is formed by a narrow creek which from the south runs
into the main inlet, about two miles from the entrance to the open sea. On
these deep and sheltered waters the whole of the Russian fleet could ride in
safety, protected by a ring of forts from attack by land or sea, and the
labours of successive generations of engineers had converted the western
shore of the creek, or inner harbour, into a vast arsenal and dockyard, round
which a thriving and populous city had sprung up. The Generals of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Anglo-French forces soon ascertained by reconnaissance that they had not
nearly men enough to invest the whole perimeter of the fortress, and at the
same time to repel the attacks to be expected from the enemy’s field troops.
All they could hope to accomplish was to pour upon one portion of the
defences a fire so heavy as to become insupportable; and as the real power
of the defence was obviously concentrated in the arsenals, stores, and barracks
round the inner harbour, the Allies selected the southern works, those
protecting the heart of the fortress, as the object of their first attack, and
took up positions on the plateau between Balaclava and Sebastopol. Bounded
on the north by the harbour, on the west and south by the sea, and on the
east by the valley of the Tchernaya, the surface of this plateau, or “Upland”
as the British termed it, was seamed by ravines which, beginning as mere
depressions in the ground, grew deeper as they approached the fortress,
finally becoming precipitous gorges, difficult for troops to cross. Close to the
harbour the ground between these gorges rose into gentle elevations, crowned
by works which, as soon as the Russians realised that the southern side of
the fortress was threatened, were heavily armed and greatly strengthened.
The largest of these ravines, dividing the plain from south to north, descended
to the head of the inner harbour, and served as the boundary between the
British on the right, and the French on the left of the besiegers’ line.</p>

<p>Owing to the inability of the Allies to invest the fortress completely,
communication continued uninterrupted between the northern part of Sebastopol
and the interior of the Crimea; early in October the civilian population
quitted the town, and thus relieved the troops of the burden of feeding
thousands of useless non-combatants. The forethought of the Russians had
collected in the magazines of Sebastopol enormous supplies of guns, ammunition,
and warlike stores; the commissariat was well provided; the garrison
consisted of 38,000 men&mdash;soldiers, military workmen already partially trained
to arms, and sailors from the men-of-war which, at the approach of the Allies,
had been sunk to block the mouth of the outer harbour. Among the regular
troops was an officer in himself worth an army&mdash;Todleben, an engineer who
had already made his mark in the fighting on the Danube. When it became
known that the Allies were sailing for the Crimea he was sent to Sebastopol,
where he became the mainspring of the defence. His courage and genius,
his versatility and resource, his boundless energy, his power of inspiring
enthusiasm and devotion among his men won for him the deepest respect of
his enemies, and the fervent admiration of his fellow countrymen, who with
good reason claim for him a high place among great military engineers. He
soon had an opportunity of displaying his talents. In the middle of October
the Allies opened fire upon the fortress, and at the close of the bombardment
had reason to be satisfied with the result, for the works were reduced to
shapeless heaps, the batteries ruined, the guns disabled. But next morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the assailants discovered that in Todleben they had to meet a master-mind:
during the night he had rebuilt the parapets, repaired the batteries, and
replaced the damaged guns from the almost boundless supply of cannon at
his command. On the 25th, the Russian Field army, which after its defeat
at the Alma had retired into the interior of the Crimea to await reinforcements,
made an unsuccessful attempt to break the line of communication
between the British camps on the Upland and Balaclava. A few days later
the Allies determined to assault the fortress, but their project was discovered
by the enemy. At dawn on the 4th of November, the garrison and the
field army together attacked the British right; and though after a desperate
battle, to which the name of Inkerman has been given, the victory remained
to the Allies, it was dearly bought: the British casualties were 597 killed and
1760 wounded, while those of the French were 143 killed and 786 wounded.
The Russians on their side lost more than 12,000 men, of whom a very large
proportion were left dead upon the field.</p>

<p>So far our army had not fared badly in the campaign: the hardships had
not been greater than were to be expected on active service, and reinforcements
had filled the gaps caused by casualties and disease. Cholera, indeed,
hung about the camp, and the men were undoubtedly overworked, for when
the Anglo-French generals drew up their plans for the siege, the share in
the operations which Lord Raglan undertook was greater than his troops
could accomplish without undue fatigue. But despite sickness and overstrain
the health of the army was fairly good, and when, a few days after
Inkerman, it was officially announced that the Allies would spend the winter
in the Crimea, men looked forward to the prospect without great apprehension,
for the weather was fine, and the Indian summer, bright, mild, and dry,
gave no hint of the rigours of the coming winter. Suddenly a terrific storm
of rain and wind burst upon the Crimea, levelled whole camps and blew the
tents, and all that the tents contained, far and wide over the Upland; the
supplies of food and forage at the front were destroyed, and communication
with Balaclava was temporarily cut off by the force of the hurricane. Had the
fleet of store-ships then at anchor at Balaclava, or lying off the port, escaped
destruction, the damage, in great measure at least, could have been repaired;
but twenty-one vessels were dashed to pieces, and eight more disabled. The
ships that went to the bottom contained forage, ammunition, war-like stores
of every kind, drugs and surgical appliances, warm flannel shirts and drawers,
woollen stockings, boots and watch-coats&mdash;everything that the army most
urgently required. When fresh supplies arrived at Balaclava from England
the means of conveying them to the Upland was utterly inadequate, for we
had landed without a transport corps, depending for land carriage on such
horses and vehicles as could be seized in the Crimea. The animals thus
obtained died fast from want of forage, and in January, 1855, the Commissariat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
department could only muster 333 horses and mules and 12 camels,
while the divisional transport consisted of a few ponies, dying from starvation
and overwork. Though horses in plenty were to be bought in the countries
near the Crimea, and many transports were available to bring them to
Balaclava, it was useless to import animals until forage arrived to feed them,
and forage unhappily was an article of which the Treasury had neglected to
make an adequate provision. Consequently upon the troops fell the whole
labour of carrying on their shoulders from the port to the camps everything
that was required, not only for their own support, but for the conduct of the
siege. As was to be expected, the men broke down terribly fast; in
November there were nearly 17,000 on the sick list; in December there were
more than 19,000 ineffectives, and in January, 1855, no less than 23,076 men
filled the hospitals. The horrors of this period of the war are well described
by Field-Marshal Sir Evelyn Wood, who served on shore as a midshipman in
one of the Naval brigades.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In the early part of the winter the battalions at the front were
generally on duty two nights out of three, and later, every alternate
night. The life of the rank and file was thus spent:&mdash;The men were
mustered carrying great-coat and blanket, just before dusk, and marched
through a sea of mud into the trenches. These were cut up by deep
holes from which boulders and stones had been taken, and into these
holes on dark nights, the men often fell. When the soldier reached his
position, he had to sit with his back to the parapet, and his feet drawn
up close under his body to allow others to pass along the four-feet-wide
trench. If he was not detailed for a working party, nor for piquet in the
trenches or in advance of them, he might lie down, resting as best he
could, in a wet ditch. Assuming that the soldier was not on piquet, and
that there was no alarm&mdash;and these were of frequent occurrence&mdash;he
could, after the working parties and their reliefs had ceased to move
about the trenches, repose till daylight, when he marched back to camp,
and after a few hours’ rest had to carry a load of some kind.</p>

<p>“The comparative repose enjoyed by those men who were required
only as a guard, or reserve in the trenches, was very different to the
condition of those who were employed from 200 to 300 yards in advance
of our works, often within conversational distance of the opposing
sentries. The reliefs for the sentries could snatch a dog’s sleep for four
hours out of six, hoping their comrades would by remaining on the alert
give them time to jump up ere the enemy was on them; but for the two
hours that each man was out near the enemy, the strain on the nervous
system would have been great even to a robust, well-fed man. These
sentries had necessarily to stand absolutely still, silent and watchful, and
as the severity of the weather became more and more marked, numbers
of men whose frames were weakened by want of adequate nutritious
food, were found in the morning frost-bitten and unable to move. One
battalion which landed nearly 900 strong early in November, was
actually in the trenches six nights out of seven, and then became so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
reduced, not only in numbers,<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> but also in the men’s bodily strength, that
it was unable for some time to go there again.</p>

<p>“When the soldier got back to camp, he used to lie, often in a puddle,
which chilled his bones, under a worn-out tent, through which the rain
beat. The less robust would fall asleep, completely worn out, to awake
shivering, and in many cases to be carried to a hospital tent scarcely more
comfortable than the tent which they had left, and thence to a grave in
two or three days. Those who were stronger, went out to collect roots
of brushwood, or of vines, and roasted the green coffee ration in the lid
of the canteen, afterwards pounding it in a fragment of shell with a
stone, ere they boiled it for use. Others, unequal to this laborious
process, would drink their rum, and eating a piece of biscuit, lie down
again in the great-coat and blanket which they had brought, often wet
through from the trenches.</p>

<p>“In the afternoon the soldier was sent on ‘fatigue’ duty from five to
seven miles, according to the position of his camp, usually to Balaclava,
to bring up rations. On his return he had again to gather fuel in order
to boil the salt beef or salt pork in his mess tin, which did not hold water
enough to abstract the salt. A portion of the meat therefore only was
consumed, and it was necessary from time to time to tell off men to bury
the quantities thrown away. Salt pork which was issued two days out
of seven, was frequently eaten by the men in its raw state, from the
difficulties of finding fuel to cook it.</p>

<p>“Shortly before dusk the soldier either marched back to the trenches,
or lay down to sleep if he was not on piquet in front of the camp. Many
men disliking to report themselves sick, were carried back from the
trenches in the morning, and died a few hours afterwards. Those who
were reported sick were taken to hospital, in many cases merely a bell
tent; here the men lay, often in mud on the ground, and in many
instances their diet was only salt meat and biscuit.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> They were moreover
so crowded together that the doctors could scarcely pass between the
patients.</p>

<p>“The Regimental Medical officers unable to provide comforts, medicine
or proper housing, were eager to send down their patients, even in storm
and rain, to Balaclava, as the best chance of saving their lives. As we
had no ambulances, and the French could not always lend us mule litter-transport,
many were necessarily carried on cavalry horses, which slipping
upon the hill outside Balaclava, often caused further injury or the death
of the patient.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“The small schoolhouse at Balaclava, which we used as a hospital,
held only between 300-400 men, thus the great majority of the sick and
wounded were necessarily laid on the beach, exposed to all weathers,
while awaiting their turn for embarcation in the transports. On the
steamer running between Balaclava and the Bosphorus&mdash;a voyage of 36 to
48 hours&mdash;the soldier seldom got anything but tea and biscuit, sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
only water. During this short but terribly trying passage, from 8 to 9%
succumbed and were thrown overboard. Once on shore there was often
a further painful wait on the beach before they were carried up to the
hospital.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“We who saw the ‘old soldier’ die without a murmur may well be
excused dilating on his virtues, when we endeavour to describe what he
suffered for our country, the ministry of which, having given him a task
far beyond his strength, failed to supply him with clothes and food. It
is impossible to overpraise the disciplined silence of men under privations,
which in a few weeks reduced one battalion from nearly 1000 effectives
to a strength of 30 rank and file.”<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p></div>

<p>This misery was at its height when the Royal Irish disembarked at
Balaclava on December 30, 1854; casualties, hardships, and disease had so
thinned the British ranks that in January, 1855, to meet all requirements
of the siege Lord Raglan had only 11,000 men at duty on the Upland,
many of whom were only fit to be in hospital: one day, indeed, after providing
fatigues to bring up the necessaries of life from Balaclava, he could
only turn out two hundred and ninety officers and men to guard his trenches&mdash;about
one-twentieth part of the garrisons of the forts opposite his works,
against which at any moment the Russians might have directed a sortie. The
regiments upon which the war had told most heavily had almost ceased to
exist: one battalion paraded for duty with a few officers, a sergeant, and seven
rank and file. With his army in such a condition, it was impossible for Lord
Raglan to continue responsible for the whole of the ground allotted to him at
the beginning of the siege, and the French, who had been very largely reinforced,
and whose sufferings, though great, were in comparison with ours but
insignificant, relieved him on the extreme right of his line. The material
result of this necessary but deplorable admission of weakness was to “sandwich”
the British between two wings of the French army, while morally it
reduced us to the position of a mere contingent in the forces of Napoleon III.
By England’s persistent neglect of all things military she had sown the storm,
and her unhappy soldiers in the Crimea reaped the whirlwind; and it was not
for many months, after thousands of lives had been wasted<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> and money spent
like water, that her army was once more able to take its proper place in the
forces of the alliance against Russia.</p>

<p>The Royal Irish were not at once sent up to the front, but for nearly
a fortnight were employed on fatigues about the port. Thanks to this delay
they were able to see their baggage and camp equipage safe on shore, and
thus, when ordered to the Upland, they began the campaign well prepared to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
face the hardships that awaited them. In this respect they were far better
off than the regiments which first landed in the Crimea. The original
expedition had disembarked with hardly any vehicles; the men were so
much enfeebled by the climate of Varna that they could not bear the weight
of their knapsacks, which with the rest of the baggage were left on board the
transports; and when these vessels ultimately reached Balaclava, knapsacks,
stores, and regimental property of every kind were lost in the confusion which
for many months reigned supreme at our base of operations. The miseries
undergone by the troops who landed at the beginning of the war have already
been described; and the ragged, jaded starvelings who dragged themselves
from the camps on the Upland to the port of Balaclava on the daily quest for
food were in pitiable contrast to the well-fed, well-clothed, well-shod men of
the XVIIIth. These material advantages doubtless contributed largely
towards the comparative immunity from sickness enjoyed by the regiment
during the siege, but an even more important factor in its well-being was the
presence in its ranks of a large number of soldiers who had been on active
service, and of many officers who had learned in two long wars not only to
take care of themselves, but also of the men under their command.</p>

<p>On January 12, 1855, the Royal Irish received orders to join Major-General
Sir William Eyre’s brigade, then composed of the 4th, 38th, and 50th
regiments, which formed part of the third division under Lieutenant-General
Sir Richard England; and leaving a guard over such of their property as they
could not carry with them, they started for the Upland. Their introduction to
campaigning in the Crimea was a rude one; a blizzard raged as they floundered
through deep snow along a track, marked by the bodies of transport animals
killed by starvation and overwork; and when late in the afternoon they
reached Eyre’s camp, they were told off by companies to find shelter in the
lines of other corps, for their own tents had been left standing at Balaclava
from want of transport to move them. When the Royal Irish succeeded
in bringing up their tents from Balaclava, they settled down in camp with
the handiness of seasoned troops. Most of the officers dug out the earth
inside their tents to a depth of eighteen inches, piling the soil on the curtains
to keep out the wind. There was no means of draining the inside of these
habitations, “holes in the ground, roofed over with canvas,” as they were well
described, but as the camp of the third division was pitched on dry and porous
ground the XVIIIth were not troubled with water inside their tents, nor
outside had they the miseries of mud and standing pools which made the
camps on low ground so wretched. As for “warming the tents,” continues
Captain Kemp’s<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> statement,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“in mine we improvised a stove out of an old square biscuit-tin; we let
part of it into the earthen wall of the dug-out tent, and made a chimney-pipe
out of round meat tins, slipped one inside the other. This chimney
passing through the soil, came out clear of the canvas and was then
turned upwards for a couple of feet. It answered well, though we were
at times half smothered with the smoke. Wood for fuel was very scarce.
A small quantity was served out for the soldiers’ cooking places, but the
men had to carry it into camp on their shoulders for a distance of two
miles or more. Their cooking was done in the usual trench in the open,
but in very severe weather&mdash;rain, wind or snow&mdash;it was impossible to
keep the fires going: this was one of the great hardships of the campaign.
The cooking for the officers was done close to their tents, in holes or
trenches dug by the servants, who used to throw the earth round the
kitchen, and cover it with any bits of canvas they could find. Our
servants had to forage for firewood, and generally brought back nothing
but the wet roots of vines which they had grubbed up.”</p></div>

<p>Each officer took out with him to the war a canteen containing cooking
utensils, plates, dishes, and cups, but the wear and tear of camp life soon
made havoc of this kit. At a farewell dinner given in March by the XVIIIth
to Colonel Reignolds when, completely broken down by hardships, he made
over the regiment to Brevet-Lieutenant-Colonel Edwards and went home
invalided, each of the officers had to cook some part of the feast in his own
kitchen, and brought the remnants of his plates, knives and forks, and the
articles of food he had provided to the dinner, where empty jam pots took the
place of soup plates and champagne glasses.</p>

<p>As soon as the Royal Irish joined Eyre’s brigade they began to do duty in
the trenches, where parties were sent for twelve hours at a time to guard the
works, make good with sand-bags the damage done to the parapets by the
enemy’s projectiles, and improve the drainage. In March, when the weather
began to moderate, the tour of duty was increased to twenty-four hours, much
to the men’s satisfaction, as those who were not wanted by day for guards or
working parties snatched some hours’ sleep in the dry caves of the great
ravine which, as has already been mentioned, marked the left of the British
front. The duty, heavy for all, was particularly hard on the officers, who
were often in the trenches for seventy-two hours in the week. By day they
had to direct the men at their labours, by night to be prepared to meet an
attack from the fortress. Thanks to their incessant care in seeing that the
men were always ready for any emergency, and to half-hourly visits to the
sentries, the officers of the XVIIIth were never surprised, and whenever the
regiment was in the trenches the Russians received so unfriendly a welcome
that they never attempted to push home, though on several occasions they
crossed bayonets with the outlying sentries. These local attacks were not the
only dangers of night work during the siege. If the wind served, and the
Russians heard a party at work, they threw fireballs, which on striking the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
ground burst into a great flare; then, guided by the light, they poured grape
upon the labourers, who used to throw themselves for shelter behind the
parapet of the trench until the cannonade ceased. Things began to brighten
on the Upland in March: a great burst of indignation at home against the
archaic methods by which the army was administered had roused the officials
of the War Office and the Treasury to a tardy sense of their shortcomings: a
gang of navvies from England had almost finished a railway from Balaclava
to the camps; a transport corps had been organised and was doing good
service,<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> and the troops, once more properly clothed, discarded the weird
garments with which they had covered their nakedness during the winter
months, and began to resume the bearing of British soldiers. So marked was
the improvement in the appearance of the men that some martinets considered
that only one thing was required to bring the army up to its old level&mdash;the
resumption of the stock, which by general consent had been discarded at the
beginning of the war: but this relic of barbarism was not taken into use for
many months, and then only on the ceremonial parades at the end of the war.
In justice to the XVIIIth it should be said that throughout the siege all ranks
managed to turn out respectably attired. The officers wore their red shell-jackets
or blue frocks under the regimental great-coat; and they were also
provided with a non-regulation garment, much like the “coat-warm-British”
of the present day, made of serge, lined with rabbit-skin, and reaching almost
to the knee. The great-coats of the men looked decent, and concealed the
blankets below them, converted into loosely fitting under-coats by the simple
expedient of cutting holes in them for the men’s arms to come through. All
ranks had fur caps, the envy of the whole army. About this time the
Minié rifles, with which the army were then supposed to be armed, were
issued to the Royal Irish, who had been hurried off to the war equipped
with Brown-Bess percussion muskets, the same weapons that they had used
in Burma.</p>

<p>Even in the worst part of the winter the Allies never wholly discontinued
their siege operations, and as the weather became less severe their parallels
were pushed forward steadily towards Sebastopol. The Russians on their
side had not been idle: large reinforcements from the field army so abundantly
made good the losses of the garrison that Todleben could command the
services of 6000, and even on occasions of 10,000 men in carrying out his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
improvements of the defences. He seized and fortified fresh ground overlooking
some of the works of the Allies, and devised a successful method of
harassing the men on duty in the trenches. Under cover of darkness he dug
numbers of shallow rifle-pits within musketry range of our lines, posting in
each a marksman whose duty it was to shoot at every living target he could
see. These pits were gradually connected by continuous trenches, and became
a source of much annoyance to the Anglo-French troops, who found them
difficult to deal with: to turn the sharpshooters out with the bayonet was
costly, while to shell so small a mark as they presented was very difficult, and
therefore little sandbag forts were run up at intervals on the parapets of the
trenches, manned by soldiers detailed to keep down the skirmishers’ fire. In
spite, however, of Todleben’s efforts the Allies succeeded in arming their
batteries with an imposing number of heavy guns, and early in April
finished their preparations for a vigorous bombardment, the prelude (as it
was universally believed) to the storming of Sebastopol. The French could
bring to bear 378 pieces of ordnance; the British had only 123 guns and
mortars available, but as for the most part they were much more powerful
than those of the French, the difference in weight of metal was not great.
The cannonade began on the 9th of April, and raged for ten days and nights,
for though the guns did not fire after the sun was down, the mortars continued
to play upon the fortress throughout the night. Though mitigated by
Todleben’s genius for rapid repairs, the effect of the bombardment was very
great, and all ranks were awaiting orders for the attack when Canrobert, who
on the death of St Arnaud had succeeded to the command of the French,
decreed that the assault was to be postponed.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> The fire of the guns was
gradually allowed to die down: the digging parties resumed work upon the
approaches: and the Russians were allowed to carry out the restoration of
their works without interruption other than that of occasional shots from our
batteries. This bombardment cost the enemy 6000 men: in the ranks of the
Allies the casualties were far smaller, amounting among the French to 1585,
among the British to 265 of all ranks.</p>

<p>Up to the middle of June the record of the XVIIIth is one of exceedingly
hard work, unbroken by the excitement of any important engagement. The
Royal Irish were employed in many different ways. They toiled along the
track, first from Balaclava, and then from railhead to the camps on the
Upland, laden, to use the soldiers’ expression, “like commissariat mules,” with
stores; they were on fatigues of every kind, from digging parallels and
throwing up batteries to making gabions and fascines; and they took their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
turn in the trenches, where, though they demanded and often obtained the
dangerous privilege of guarding the approaches nearest to the enemy, their
losses were small. Between the 6th of February, when their first casualty
occurred, and the 17th of June, only six men were killed and thirty-six
wounded. Of these injuries, however, many were of the gravest nature: on
one occasion a shell from a Russian mortar burst among a detachment on its
way to the trenches and struck down ten of the party. To save the lives of
the wounded the surgeons had to perform amputations upon each of them, and
seven men lost a leg apiece, two an arm each, while the least hurt escaped
with the loss of a hand. This comparative immunity from casualties, however,
was not to last, for the regiment was now to be called upon to undergo
an ordeal nearly as severe as those in its campaigns under William III. and
Marlborough. At the beginning of June the immediate object of the Allies
was the capture of three outlying fortifications, outposts which covered the
left of the line of Russian defences. The trenches of the French right attack
were faced by the White Works and a hill called “the Mamelon,” the latter of
which barred the way to the Malakoff redoubt, one of the keys of the main
position; the British sap led to “the Quarries,” where a number of works
covered the Redan, a fort as formidable and as important as the Malakoff
itself. On the 6th of June another great bombardment began; five hundred
and forty-four pieces of heavy ordnance hurled shot and shell into the
Russian works, and though answered by almost an equal number inflicted
great injury: many cannon were dismounted and earth-works ruined before
darkness imposed silence upon our guns, though not upon our howitzers,
which continued to fire throughout the night. Thanks to the boundless
energy of Todleben and the dogged industry of his men, much of the damage
was made good before dawn; the cannon were remounted and the parapets
rebuilt; but early in the morning the English and French re-opened fire with
such terrible effect that in two hours the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">morale</i> of the defenders was seriously
affected. Then the infantry of the Allies was let loose, and after heavy
fighting succeeded in taking the points assailed. In these achievements the
XVIIIth had no part, as the third division was not employed in the capture
of the Quarries.</p>

<p>As soon as these three outlying works had been taken, the Allies began
to prepare for an attack on the Malakoff and the Redan, and on the 17th of
June the batteries concentrated a furious fire on the Russian fortifications,
with results so destructive to the enemy’s artillery that everything appeared
to promise success for the assault on the morrow. Lord Raglan and Marshal
Pélissier, who had recently been placed in command of the French army,
had already agreed upon their plans; remembering how rapidly during the
night of the 6th-7th of June the Russians had re-fitted their batteries,
the Generals decided that the cannonade should be resumed at daylight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
for two hours, when it was calculated that the enemy’s guns would be
silenced and the repairs of the night destroyed. The infantry was then
to come into action, the French against the Malakoff, the British against
the Redan. Barnard’s brigade of the third division was to support the
storming columns, while on the extreme left Eyre, with the other brigade
of the same division, was to threaten the fortifications on the Russian right
of the Redan and in front of the Dockyard Creek, and to convert his
demonstration into a serious attack if the assault on the Redan proved
successful. Raglan’s preparations for the execution of his part of this
scheme were completed, when suddenly, late on the night of the 17th,
Pélissier informed the British Commander-in-Chief that he had resolved to
dispense with the preliminary bombardment, and to storm the Malakoff
at daybreak. Against his own judgment, and in an evil hour for the
Allied armies, Raglan consented to this all-important change of plan; the
infantry attacks on the Malakoff and the Redan were delivered without
adequate artillery preparation; Todleben, who had done wonders during
the night, was ready at every point, and the combined assault was beaten
back with heavy loss. The only troops on whom Fortune smiled this
day were those of Eyre’s brigade, who fought magnificently, and worthily
sustained the honour of the British army. The brigade was at this time
composed of the 9th, XVIIIth, 28th, 38th, and 44th regiments, but so
heavily had the campaign told upon them that, when in the small hours
of the 18th of June Eyre mustered these five battalions, there were but
two thousand men in their depleted ranks. Covered by an advance-guard
of a hundred and fifty sharpshooters&mdash;volunteers from each company in
his command&mdash;the General left his camp while it was still black night,
and marched down the great ravine towards the Dockyard Creek. At
daybreak, just as the troops detailed for the assault on the Redan were
swarming out of the trenches in which they had been assembled, Eyre’s
advance-guard reached a cemetery, surprised the occupants of the rifle
pits by which it was defended, and captured it without much trouble.
This cemetery marked one flank of the enemy’s line, the other rested on
a mamelon;<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> and to quote the words of Eyre’s report, the intervening
ground “was intersected, and the road barricaded with stone walls, which
our men were obliged to pull down under fire before they could advance.
In rear of this position, towards the fortress, the enemy occupied several
houses, there were bodies of the enemy seen in rear, but in what strength
I could not say. This position, under cover of the walls of the fortress,
was strong.” Well might General Eyre describe the position as “strong.”
The suburb, of which these houses formed part, consisted of villas standing
in gardens, planted with peach-trees in full blossom, and surrounded with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
low stone walls, thickly overgrown with vines. From several points it
was commanded by the Russian artillery; to our “half-left” was the Garden
Wall battery; in front rose the Creek battery, built at the head of the
inner harbour of Sebastopol; on our right was the Barrack battery, and
hidden behind the Redan were field-guns, which after the assault on that
work had failed turned their fire upon Eyre’s regiments.</p>

<p>Before describing the doings of the XVIIIth in detail it will be well to
give a short account of the work done by the brigade as a whole. Such
an account is to be found in the letter to ‘The Times’<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> by Sir William
Russell, the celebrated war correspondent, who, writing only two days after
the battle, seems to have obtained his facts from the reports supplied to
Eyre by the officers commanding his units. As Russell’s letter is in substantial
agreement with Eyre’s report to his divisional general, its evidence
appears valuable. After mentioning that the advance-guard occupied the
cemetery with small loss, he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“the moment the enemy retreated, their batteries opened a heavy
fire on the place from the left of the Redan and from the Barrack
battery. Four companies of the XVIIIth at once rushed on out of
the cemetery towards the town, and actually succeeded in getting
possession of the suburb. Captain Hayman was gallantly leading on
his company when he was shot through the knee. Captain Esmonde
followed, and the men, once established, prepared to defend the houses
they occupied.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> As they drove the Russians out, they were pelted
with large stones by the latter on their way up to the battery, which
quite overhangs the suburb. The Russians could not depress their
guns sufficiently to fire down on our men, but they directed a severe
flanking fire on them from an angle of the Redan works. There was
nothing for it but to keep up a vigorous fire from the houses, and to
delude the enemy into the belief that the occupiers were more numerous
than they were. Meanwhile the Russians did their best to blow down
the houses with shot and shell, and fired grape incessantly, but the
soldiers kept close, though they lost men occasionally, and they were
most materially aided by the fire of the regiments in the cemetery
behind them, which was directed at the Russian embrasures; so that
the enemy could not get out to fire on the troops below. The 9th
regiment succeeded in effecting a lodgment in the houses in two or
three different places, and held their position as well as the XVIIIth.... While
these portions of the 9th and XVIIIth, and parties of the 44th
and 28th were in the houses, the detachments of the same regiments
and of the 38th kept up a hot fire from the cemetery on the Russians
in the battery and on the sharpshooters, all the time being exposed
to a tremendous shower of bullets, grape, round-shot, shell. The loss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
of the brigade under such circumstances, could not but be extremely
severe. One part of it, separated from the other, was exposed to a
destructive fire in houses, the upper portion of which crumbled into
pieces or fell in under fire, and it was only by keeping in the lower
storey, which was vaulted and well built, that they were enabled to
hold their own. The other parts of it, far advanced from our batteries,
were almost unprotected, and were under a constant mitraille and
bombardment from guns which our batteries had failed to touch.”</p></div>

<p>Though the repulse of the main British column left Eyre in a situation
of hourly increasing peril, he resolutely continued to hold the points
which the dash and bravery of his troops had gained. At first he hoped
that the Redan might yet be stormed, when his brigade would be ready
to follow up the victory; and when it became clear that the attack was
not to be renewed he declined to fall back, until an authority higher than
his own had decided how much of the ground that his brigade had won
was to be retained. Though Eyre was wounded comparatively early in
the day, it was not until late in the afternoon that, after giving orders
for the gradual withdrawal of the troops from the houses nearest to the
enemy, he made over his command to the next senior officer and quitted the
battlefield. The process of withdrawal took several hours, and it was
not until 9 <span class="fs70">P.M.</span> that the Royal Irish, the last regiment of the brigade to
retire, began its march back to the camp of the third division.</p>

<p>How the XVIIIth fared must now be told, as far as possible, in the words of
the officers who had the honour to be present. Late on the 17th, the rumour
had run through the lines of the Royal Irish that the town was to be assaulted
next day. The men were wild with joy at the prospect of taking part in
the attack, and talked and sang in their tents so incessantly that the
officers could get no rest during the few hours allowed the regiment for
sleep. At 1 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span> on the 18th of June, a date ever memorable in the annals
of the regiment, six hundred and sixty-nine officers and men paraded in
front of the camp of the 9th regiment, where the brigade was formed,
the XVIIIth in front, the 44th, 38th, 28th, and 9th regiments following
in the order named. On the march down the great ravine occurred an
interesting instance of the rigidity of the drill which, in the middle of
the nineteenth century, fettered the movements of the British army. It
has been mentioned that every infantry regiment then had two flank companies
of picked men: those of the right, or grenadier company, were
chosen for height and strength; those of the left, or Light company, were
selected for activity and intelligence. On the parade ground the rule
was that all battalion movements should be made from the right, and
consequently that in column the grenadier company should always lead.
Colonel Edwards had learned in the school of the Chinese and Burmese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
wars that all drill is but the means to one end, the successful attack on
an enemy; and thinking that on this occasion the quick-moving “Light
Bobs” were the men first to be employed, marched off “left in front.”
This daring innovation did not long pass unnoticed, and almost within
sight of the enemy he was ordered to halt, and countermarch his regiment
in order to bring the grenadier company to the head of the column. In
1855, the countermarch was an evolution slow and ponderous in broad
daylight, and doubly difficult of execution in semi-darkness, at a time when
the pulses of all ranks were throbbing with the excitement of a night march
and an impending battle. After the manœuvre was carried out, the brigade
once more advanced, forming into a mass of close columns whenever the
ground permitted. Though it was now almost day the Russians had not
yet detected the presence of Eyre’s troops, and the General took an opportunity
of addressing the Royal Irish, telling them he knew they would
prove themselves good soldiers and “this day do something that will ring
in every cabin in Ireland.” Then he added, “Now, men, above all things
you must be quiet or you’ll get peppered!” In answer to this very reasonable
appeal a shout arose from the ranks, “All right, your Honour, we’ll
get in. Three cheers for the General!” Before the officers could stop them
the men had given three lusty cheers. Eyre remonstrated, but the Royal Irish
were far too eager for the fray to be sensible, and in response to his reiterated
entreaties for silence they burst out into stentorian cheering, this time for
Old Ireland. “Let them go in and attack,” cried the General in despair;
“they will only draw fire upon us!”</p>

<p>From a letter written by Colonel Edwards two days after the battle, it
appears that while the advance-guard was driving the Russians from the
cemetery at the point of the bayonet, the XVIIIth</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“halted in the open ready for action. Just here the first round-shot
danced among us, and as the advance party had extended and were
under such cover as they could find, we met the intruder. That peculiar
thud (once heard, never forgotten) denoted that the round-shot had
told, two men being killed. But we were compelled to wait a little
longer, and then the Grenadier company moved off in skirmishing order,
soon followed by Nos. 1 and 2 companies. These three companies
occupied the ruined houses on the Woronzoff road.”</p></div>

<p>As the grenadiers, led by Captain Armstrong, were pressing forward
they found their way obstructed by one of the stone walls mentioned in
General Eyre’s report. Two subalterns raced for the wall, and leapt it at
the same moment: Lieutenant Taylor landed safely on the other side, but
Lieutenant Meurant was shot dead as he rose at the jump. Soon afterwards
the remainder of the regiment in column of sections was moved
forward in support, along a lane leading towards the suburb from the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
ravine, the rocky cliffs of which gave the XVIIIth some cover from cannon
shot. The Russian riflemen, however, speedily found the range, “and the
men,” says Colonel Edwards,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“commenced to fall fast. The General had given me orders to stand
there, but the casualties were then so great that I put the men behind
the houses and walls, which saved them much. I did not see the General
again; he was wounded across the head.</p>

<p>“All this time the men were coming back from the front, hopping
or crouching according to the nature of the wound, amongst them my
friend Captain Hayman, supported by two men, shot through the knee,
but with a cheerful smile on his face. Seeing that the advance was
much weakened I supported them with two other companies, sending
Major Kennedy to the front; he was shortly after slightly hit on the
side of the head, but not compelled to return. The enemy knew well
the position of the houses they were in, and threw the shell amongst
them. Fancy one of these visitors falling within ten feet of you&mdash;down
you must lie, and close too, and wait for its bursting, when you
are fortunate if you have nothing worse than dust to complain of! They
not only gave shells, but rifle-balls and grape, and many a poor fellow
who went out to help a wounded comrade was obliged in his turn to
be carried in desperately wounded.</p>

<p>“Again the front calls out for ammunition and more men. ‘Up, my
boys, catch hold of that barrel of ammunition, and rush through the
whizzing balls, the tearing grape!’ Away they go with a cheer! About
12 o’clock the last company but one went out and other companies,
returning, dreadfully thinned, formed the support. Shortly after one,
more men were wanted; I sent out the last company and went myself.
Away we hop from stone to stone or bush: ‘ping-ping’ passes the
rifle-bullet crashing around you; you feel the grape; never mind, on
you must go! I found the advanced parties in a row of houses under
the battery, regularly enclosed by a screen of projectiles; you could
only creep about. In the morning these houses had been occupied by
the Russians; by the time I got there, everything was broken:&mdash;pier
glasses in shivers; the piano (or as a man called it, the music-box) torn
open; beds, tables and wardrobes in jumbles of masses. The enemy
did not like our being there, nor did they like that the houses gave
us cover; they therefore set fire to them with shells. About 3 o’clock
I received an order to retire, which I could not comply with as there
were eighteen wounded men to bring away, which could not be done
till dark.”</p></div>

<p>According to Colonel Edwards, the three companies of the XVIIIth in the
ruined houses on the Woronzoff road and the other battalions of the brigade
also received this order, and gradually drew back, leaving the greater part of
the Royal Irish in a most dangerous situation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Every moment our small party was decreasing. What weary hours
they seemed from three till eight, and just before it was time to move, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
enemy brought field-pieces to bear upon the houses, and they commenced
knocking them down about our heads. At last I heard with joy ‘The
last wounded man has been carried off, Sir.’ ‘Well, then, go away by
twos and threes: keep up a warm fire. When across the open, bugler,
sound the Regimental Call and the Retire.’</p>

<p>“The work is done, but out of 669 men who left the camp, 250 of the
Royal Irish had suffered more or less. We did not get home till ten
o’clock, wearied and exhausted. The remainder of the brigade acted on
our right, and the 44th lost nearly as many in proportion as we did.
Our brigade was more than successful, and have received great praise,
especially the Royal Irish regiment.”</p></div>

<p>In so broken and disjointed a combat it is always difficult for the General
to select officers and men for special commendation. Eyre appears to have
found it impossible to do so, and after stating in his report that every one in
his brigade “most nobly performed his duty,” and that “the conduct of all
was so exemplary that he could scarcely with justice particularize individuals,”
he contented himself with mentioning the names of his staff and the officers
commanding the advance-guard and the five regiments of the brigade.
Colonel Edwards’ report on the part played by the XVIIIth doubtless recorded
some of the deeds of valour performed by the Royal Irish; but unhappily no
copy of this document has been preserved in the archives of the regiment.
His letter, vivid and deeply interesting as it is, was written, it is believed, for
the information of Her Majesty, Queen Victoria, and aims obviously at giving
a general account of the engagement, without any unnecessary detail. The
“Digest of Service” should have contained every particular of the doings of
the regiment, but unfortunately it was compiled by an officer who recorded the
adventures of the XVIIIth in the Crimea in two or three loosely-written
pages of foolscap, from which everything of historical value was omitted.
Thus the only accounts of the exploits of the Royal Irish on the 18th of June
are to be found in a few statements, contributed by officers many years after
the war was over, and in the dry official words announcing the bestowal of
decorations. Every soldier knows that for one specially brave deed reported
after an engagement, scores pass unnoticed or are forgotten, and therefore the
instances now given can be regarded only as specimens of the conduct of the
regiment as a whole.</p>

<p>Captain Thomas Esmonde was awarded the Victoria Cross<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> for two acts
of bravery, the first of which was performed on the 18th of June. The
Gazette runs as follows: “for having, after being engaged in the attack on
the Redan,<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> repeatedly assisted at great personal risk under a heavy fire of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
shell and grape, in rescuing wounded men from exposed situations; and also,
while in command of a covering party two days after, for having rushed with
the most prompt and daring gallantry to a spot where a fire-ball from the
enemy had just been lodged, which he effectually extinguished before it had
betrayed the position of the working party under his protection, thus saving
it from a murderous fire of shell and grape, which was immediately opened
upon the spot where the fire-ball had fallen.”</p>

<p>Captain Dillon volunteered to rescue from under a heavy fire of grape and
musketry seven wounded men, who were lying in the houses nearest to the
Russian works, and succeeded in doing so.</p>

<p>Sergeant John Grant belonged to one of the companies in the houses
nearest to the Russian battery, and brought a message from his captain to
Colonel Edwards. When Colonel Edwards saw that Sergeant Grant was
bleeding from two severe wounds he desired him to fall back out of harm’s
way, but Grant so earnestly begged to be allowed to return to his officer that
Colonel Edwards permitted him once more to risk his life in crossing the fire-swept
belt of ground between the supports and his own company. Grant
lived for many years to enjoy an annuity of £20, which accompanied the
medal for meritorious service in the field, awarded to him for this act of
bravery.</p>

<p>Lieutenant T. D. Baker displayed great gallantry throughout the day, as
did Sergeant John Gleeson, Corporal Niel O’Donnell, and privates J. Weir,
E. Loughton, and J. Byrne.</p>

<p>As an instance of the spirit shown by the wounded who were left upon the
field, this story is quoted from Russell’s account of the battle. During the
armistice of the 19th for the collection of the wounded and the burial of the
dead, Major-General Eyre came to the part of the cemetery where a sergeant
of the Royal Irish lay, with both his legs broken by a round-shot. “General,”
exclaimed the non-commissioned officer, “thank God, <em>we</em> did <em>our</em> work,
anyway. Had I another pair of legs, the country and you would be welcome
to them!”</p>

<p>The operations of the 17th and 18th cost the French 3500 men, the
British 1500, the Russians 5400, and of the six generals and commanders,
French and English, who led the attacks on the 18th, four were killed and one
disabled. When Eyre’s casualty returns were made up, it was found that his
brigade had lost 562 killed and wounded. To this total the Royal Irish
contributed no less than 259, almost 39 per cent of the regiment as it went
into action. Among the officers, Lieutenant J. W. Meurant was killed, and ten
were wounded, several being dangerously or severely injured. They were&mdash;Major
J. C. Kennedy; Captains J. Cormick, A. W. S. F. Armstong, M. Hayman,
H. F. Stephenson, and J. G. Wilkinson; Lieutenants W. O’B. Taylor, W. Kemp,
F. Fearnley, and C. Hotham. Of the other ranks 57 were killed or mortally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
wounded, 16 were dangerously and 87 severely wounded, and 88 more slightly
injured.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> The wounded were gradually carried back to the camp of the
IIIrd brigade, which they soon filled to overflowing. To our modern ideas
the preparations for their reception were singularly rough. “So many of us
had been hit,” writes Captain Kemp, who himself had been struck by a bullet
in the knee, “that the orderly room and mess huts and every other available
place was appropriated for our use. At first my leg was doomed to come off,
and I was laid on the amputation table for the purpose, but as I was too weak
then it was left on till the morrow. Next day I was allowed to retain it by
the decision of one of the staff surgeons, who said, most luckily for me, ‘Let
us give the poor lad a chance,’ but I became very ill from fever and the
intense heat of the tent,<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> and shortly afterwards was ordered home. I was
moved to Balaclava in one of the ‘carrying chairs’ slung on the side of a mule,
and fainted nearly all the way from sun and weakness.”</p>

<p>After their double repulse at the Malakoff and the Redan the Allies lost no
time in resuming the ordinary operations of the siege: their approaches were
steadily pushed forward, and their guns kept up a heavy fire upon the fortress.
In July the average daily loss in Sebastopol was two hundred and fifty,
while each day in August saw the strength of the garrison diminished by
eight or nine hundred officers and men. The Russians, magnificently stubborn
fighters as they were, began to realise that the place was becoming untenable.
The parapets were crumbling under the projectiles of the Anglo-French
artillery; many guns were disabled or worn out, and though there was still a
large reserve of cannon in the arsenal, the fire of our mortars made it
impossible to mount them on the shattered batteries. Round the disabled
guns the dead lay in great heaps, while the wounded could not be moved
till darkness brought some respite to the harassed garrison. Barracks,
arsenals, and store-houses were all more or less in ruins; and the hospitals,
overflowing into the streets and squares of the town, were rapidly emptied
into a cemetery, grimly termed “the grave of the Hundred Thousand.” Towards
the end of August the Russians determined to abandon Sebastopol;
they began to build a bridge across the outer harbour, strong enough to carry
guns and waggons upon its sixteen feet of roadway; threw up barricades
across the streets of the town, and laid great mines under the forts and
magazines. On the 5th of September, the Allies once more brought all their
guns into action, and bombarded the fortress, almost without intermission, for
three days and nights, and on the 8th, the French once more assaulted the
Malakoff, and the British the Redan. As the third division was in the reserve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
and did not come into action, the XVIIIth regiment was not engaged, and
therefore all that need be said about the result is that we failed to take the
Redan, while the French carried the Malakoff, and succeeded in holding it
against the strenuous efforts of the enemy to recapture it. These attacks were
made by the Russian rear-guard to gain time for the retreat of the main body
from the southern shores of the harbour, and were so far successful that when
the French General heard that the head of the enemy’s column was marching
over the bridge, he was still too uncertain of ultimate success to attempt any
interference with the retirement. During the night the Russians successfully
exploded many of their mines; destroyed their few remaining warships; set
fire to the town in many places, and called in the troops from the forts; and
by daybreak on the 9th the whole of the garrison, carrying with them most
of the wounded, had crossed the bridge, broken it behind them, and found
safety on the heights to the north of the harbour of Sebastopol. The losses
on both sides in this, the last important episode in the Crimean War, were
very heavy. Our defeat at the Redan cost us 2271 officers and men, among
whom were three generals, wounded: the French casualties amounted to
7567 of all ranks, including five generals killed and four wounded: the
Russians lost nine generals and 12,906 other officers and men.</p>

<p>With the fall of the fortress the war in the Crimea came virtually to an
end. The Allies had accomplished their self-imposed task of destroying
Sebastopol and the Black Sea fleet; there was no immediate object to be
gained by a pitched battle with the Russian Field army; disagreements on
questions of future policy caused a considerable amount of friction between
the Ministers of Queen Victoria and the Emperor Napoleon III., and fettered
the movements of the Generals, who engaged in no further operations except
two comparatively unimportant raids against the towns of Eupatoria and
Kilburn, in neither of which the XVIIIth regiment took part. The French,
indeed, were not anxious, if indeed they were able, to continue the war; but
the English had atoned, though very tardily, for their previous neglect of their
army, by preparing so energetically for another campaign, that in November
there were in the Crimea 51,000 British troops, a contingent of 20,000 Turks,
raised, trained, and officered by Englishmen, and a German legion of ten
thousand men.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> The good health of this large body of soldiery showed how
excellent our system of administration had become at the seat of war; at
home recruits were forthcoming in great numbers; the militia had relieved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the troops in the United Kingdom and the Mediterranean of much garrison
duty; Malta was full of trained soldiers, eager to be employed on active
service; in short, the Army, purified by the ordeal it had passed through,
had become once more a first-rate fighting machine. But the troops arriving
after the fall of the fortress had no opportunity of distinguishing themselves,
for though the enemy annoyed us by cannonading Sebastopol from the
northern shore of the harbour, he made no offensive movement against the
camps on the Upland. Thus the second winter in the Crimea was a time of
comparative rest for the greater part of the army, though not for the
regiments placed at the disposal of the Royal Engineers to complete the
destruction of the forts, arsenals, and dockyards of the fortress. To the
Royal Irish fell a very heavy task, the demolition of the docks in the inner
harbour. As Colonel Edwards was senior to the engineer officer in charge of
the work, the headquarters of the XVIIIth remained outside the town, and
Major Call was placed in command of the working parties, which practically
consisted of the whole of the Royal Irish. The labour of preparing the docks
for destruction was very great, and the hardships of the men extreme: to
quote the words of the general order of February 7, 1856, praising the zeal
and perseverance of all ranks, and thanking Major Call, among other officers,
for his valuable services, “the work was carried out in the depth of winter;
the docks occasionally flooded, the shafts filled with water, the pumps choked
with frost; but all ranks united to overcome difficulties, and the mass of
ruins is a proof of the success attending the cheerful performance of a
laborious duty.”</p>

<p>This official record is not the only testimony to the good behaviour of the
Royal Irish while they worked like navvies in the docks. General C. G.
Gordon, who as a young officer of Royal Engineers had served in the Crimea,
replied to a request for information about the doings of the XVIIIth at the
siege of Sebastopol in a characteristic letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right fs80">“<span class="smcap">Port Louis</span>, 3/3/82.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Major Savile</span>,&mdash;Thanks for your note received to-day. I
am afraid I cannot write anything which would be of value about the
18th Royal Irish, as it is now 28 years ago or nearly so, since the Crimea.
I know that they were a favourite regiment with the R.E. for work, both
in the trenches and in the destruction of the docks, from the energy and
pluck of the officers and men, and it was then that I formed my opinion
of Irishmen being of a different nature than other Britishers inasmuch as
they required a certain management and consideration, which, if given
them, would enable you, so to speak, to hold their lives in your hand.
The officers liked the men and the men liked the officers; they were a
jovial lot altogether, but they would do anything if you spoke and
treated them as if you liked them, which I certainly did. You know
what great hardships they went through in the Docks in working at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
shafts which, 30 feet deep, were often full of water, if left, unpumped
out, for 12 hours. Poor devils! wet, draggled, in their low ammunition
boots, I used to feel much for them, for the Generals used to be down on
them because they were troublesome, which they were when people did
not know how to manage them.</p>

<p>“Kindest regards to General Edwards, a fine, clever old officer who
had all our respect.</p>

<p>“I am sorry I can write you no details.&mdash;Believe me, yours sincerely,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">C. G. Gordon</span>.”</p></div>

<p>It will be noticed that neither in the official expression of thanks nor in
Gordon’s letter is there any reference to the fact that the Russians frequently
shelled the working parties at the docks. The troops were so used to being
under fire that they looked upon it as an everyday occurrence, and a few
casualties were considered unworthy of notice. Thanks, however, to Colonel
Elliot’s diary, we know that rheumatic fever and frost-bite were not the only
dangers to which the Royal Irish were exposed. On December 3, 1855, the
Russians fired two hundred and fifty shells, wounding four men of the regiment;
on the 21st they dropped three shells into a barrack-room, luckily
without hitting any one, but smashing beds, knapsacks, and rifles in every
direction; on the last day of the year a shell carried away the arm of a
private, &mdash;&mdash; Fitzgerald.</p>

<p>While with immense difficulty the English and French engineers were
levelling the naval and military buildings to the ground, and shattering the
docks beyond all hope of restoration, the diplomatists of Europe were doing
their utmost to bring hostilities to an end; late in February an armistice was
arranged, and on the 30th of March, 1856, the world was gladdened by the
news that peace had been proclaimed. The effort to save Constantinople from
the Russians, though successful, had cost England dear, as these grim figures
show&mdash;</p>

<p>Though our Allies also suffered severely, the losses of the Western Powers
and of the Ottoman Empire pale into insignificance before those of the
Russians. During the last six months of the siege 81,000 soldiers were killed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
or wounded in or around Sebastopol; the whole campaign in the Crimea cost
the Czar 153,000 troops; while the reinforcements from the interior of Russia
endured such terrible hardships on the march to the Black Sea that hundreds
of thousands of men broke down on the way. It is believed that Russia’s
total loss during the war was not less than half a million of men.</p>

<p>In the other ranks, 41 were killed, 44 died of wounds, 70 died from
accident or disease, and 275 were wounded. Their names will be found in
<a href="#APPENDIX_2I">Appendix 2 (I)</a>.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>During the first nine months of its service in the Crimea, the regiment
was reinforced by 289 non-commissioned officers and men, who arrived in
drafts from home, and later from Malta where the four reserve companies
were stationed; and on September 9, although between 140 and 150 men
had been killed or died in hospital, and 219 had been invalided or become
ineffective from various causes, there remained, exclusive of officers, no less than
724 effectives present with the Colours.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> The XVIIIth regiment was among
the last to leave the Crimea; it was not until June 20, that it embarked on
H.M.S. <i>Majestic</i>, an eighty-gun ship, fitted with an auxiliary screw. Though
the crew received their soldier passengers most hospitably, the voyage was not
an agreeable one. The subalterns were berthed in the cockpit, where, as one
of them recorded in his diary, “there was no room to wash, or dress, or put
our baggage; sentries and reliefs passed through our sleeping-place all night
long, shaking us out of our hammocks; then at a certain hour ruthless sailors
came and packed away the hammocks, whether you wanted to get up or not;
and finally, there was no place to be sick, for the bulwarks were so high that
you could not see over them!” On the 18th of July the Royal Irish landed at
Portsmouth, entrained for Farnborough, and were marching thence to Aldershot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
when they were ordered to quicken their pace as Queen Victoria was
waiting to welcome the regiment. Colonel Edwards thus describes Her
Majesty’s inspection of the soldiers who had fought her battles in China,
Burma, and the Crimea: “When formed in line the appearance of the
regiment showed signs of service, the old clothing, long beards, and the
dust of the march giving the men but a sorry aspect. Her Majesty, passing
down the line on foot, requested me to point out men most deserving of her
notice. My answer was, ‘Were I to do so, the whole regiment would step to
the front.’ However, several of the wounded officers and men were presented.
When the Queen arrived in front of the Colours, I respectfuly submitted
to Her Majesty that the regimental badge of the Harp and Crown had been
removed from the uniforms of the men, and the Queen most graciously gave
orders that they should be restored.”</p>

<p>For their services in the Crimea many officers, non-commissioned officers,
and men received promotion or reward. Lieutenant-Colonels C. A. Edwards
and J. C. Kennedy were appointed to be Companions of the Order of the
Bath; Edwards also was made a Brevet-Colonel; Major G. F. S. Call,
Captains J. Cormick, A. W. S. F. Armstrong, J. Laurie, and M. J. Hayman
each received a step in brevet rank. Captain T. Esmonde was one of the
first to receive the Victoria Cross, and the newly instituted medal for distinguished
conduct in the field was awarded to Sergeant H. Morton, Corporals
M. Egan and T. Murphy, and the following private soldiers, viz., R. Baglin,
E. Erwin, T. Flannery, H. Forrestall, R. Marshall, W. Major, J. M. Guinness,
N. O’Neill, J. Sessman, 2830 P. Whelan, 3521 P. Whelan.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> In the matter of
foreign decorations the XVIIIth fared well, as each of our Allies presented
orders or medals to specially deserving officers and men. Brevet-Colonel
Edwards, Brevet-Majors Armstrong and Hayman, Sergeant-Major T. Watt,
and Sergeant J. Grant were created members of the French Legion of Honour
by Napoleon III., who also bestowed war medals on Colour-Sergeant E.
Dunne, Sergeant J. Harvey, Sergeant J. Gleeson, Corporal N. O’Donnell,
and Privates J. Cox, E. Laughton, and J. Byrne. Victor Emmanuel gave the
Sardinian war medal to Lieutenant-Colonel J. C. Kennedy, Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel
Call, Lieutenant T. D. Baker, and Private J. Weir. The Turkish
Order of the Medjidie was awarded to Colonel Edwards, Lieutenant-Colonel
J. C. Kennedy, Brevet-Major Cormick, and Lieutenants C. Hotham, O’B.
Taylor, W. Kemp, and C. J. Coote. The British medal for the Crimea and
clasp for Sebastopol and the Turkish medal were awarded to all who had
taken part in the siege, and the word “Sebastopol” added to the battle
honours of the regiment.</p>

<span class="fs55">OPERATIONS DURING THE MUTINY IN INDIA.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">Four days after the Queen had inspected the regiment it moved to Dublin,
where the arrival of the reserve companies from Malta and the depôt from
Preston brought up the numbers at headquarters to seventeen hundred and
sixty-nine of all ranks. On the 25th of August, new Colours were presented
by the Earl of Carlisle, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the old Colours finding a
fitting resting-place in St Patrick’s Cathedral, where they hang over the
monuments to the Royal Irishmen who laid down their lives for their
country in the swamps of China, in the jungles of Burma, and on
the blood-stained glacis of the fortress of Sebastopol. A few months
later the regiment was warned for foreign service, this time at the Cape
of Good Hope, but the order was cancelled when the news reached England
that the native army of Bengal had mutinied, and the XVIIIth remained in
Ireland, very indignant at not being sent at once to help quell the rising in
India. It was not until the autumn of 1857 that the War Office determined
to employ the Royal Irish in the East: an advance party of three companies
(in all, 208 officers and men) embarked on September 24, followed in two
months by headquarters and the remainder of the XVIIIth (666 of all ranks),
who reached Bombay early in February, 1858.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> They landed, hoping to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
be in time to take an active part in the campaign, and their disappointment
was bitter when they were ordered to Poona, a great city in the Bombay
Presidency. The Royal Irish found much heavy work awaiting them, for
the place was then, as it still is, a hot-bed of sedition, ready to revolt at any
moment; and the troops were constantly under arms to prevent an outbreak.
But as the accounts of successive British victories in northern and central
India reached the malcontents, the danger diminished, and in April, 1858, the
local situation had sufficiently improved to warrant the withdrawal of part
of the British garrison from Poona. On the Royal Irish was thrown the
duty of providing detachments in various places in western India, to watch
native regiments of doubtful loyalty, and help the civil power in re-establishing
law and order round their posts. With the dispersal of the regiment
disappeared its chances of service as a complete unit, but each company
commander still hoped to have to deal individually with a body of rebels, or
with one of the bands of marauders called into existence by the mutiny.
Fate, however, was not kind to the Royal Irish in 1858-59: the strenuous
work of the detachments was unrelieved by a single fight, and even when
three or four companies were brought together for some combined movement
they had no luck; in extreme heat they made forced marches,
cut roads through jungle, forded rivers, but all to no purpose: wherever
they went the enemy disappeared, to fall into the hands of some column
operating many miles away.</p>

<p>In a letter from D<sup>r</sup> Ffolliott, one of the regimental assistant-surgeons,
are preserved a few details of the experiences of one of the detachments.
Captain J. Canavan started from Poona on April 23, 1858, with two subalterns
and a hundred and twenty of the Royal Irish, a company of Bombay
native infantry, camel transport, and dhoolies for the sick and wounded, and
at the end of a month’s hard marching brought his column to Asseerghur
without a casualty and with no sick men. According to Ffolliott, who was
in medical charge, this immunity from disease was due to the care taken
to keep the men’s clothing dry at the numerous fords through which the
road ran: the troops were allowed ample time to undress before going into
the water, and to put their clothes on again before the march was resumed.
Asseerghur was an old native fortress, perched on the top of an almost
perpendicular rock rising nearly eight hundred feet out of the plain. As it
had never been occupied by European troops, there were no barracks; the
men were quartered in an old mosque; while the officers occupied a large
bungalow, where they used to entertain a few European ladies who had
taken refuge in Asseerghur while their husbands were in the field. Every
week there was a dinner-party, followed by a dance to the drums and fifes of
the detachment.</p>

<p>On his way to take up the command of a brigade at Mhow, Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Edwards was present at one of these entertainments, where he must have
been pleased at the determination of his officers to keep up their spirits
under the bitter disappointment of finding themselves thus completely “sidetracked.”
In November, Asseerghur was greatly excited at the report that
Tantia Tope was in the neighbourhood. Tantia was one of the few native
leaders who had shown good military qualities; he had fought well against
Lord Strathnairn (then Sir Hugh Rose) in central India, and when after
many defeats he had betaken himself to the country north of the Nerbudda,
he had evaded the columns threatening him from many directions. The net,
however, was now closing in upon him; it was believed he would try to
break southwards into the Deccan, and as Asseerghur commanded one of the
approaches to this part of India it became a place of temporary importance.
One evening the Fort Adjutant bustled into the quarters of the XVIIIth
with great news: in a few hours Tantia Tope, with eight or nine thousand
men, was going to attack Burhanpore, a rich and populous town not many
miles away; Canavan with fifty men of the Royal Irish was to throw himself
into the city, and Ffolliott was to accompany him. While Canavan was
issuing his orders, Ffolliott went off to make medical arrangements at the
hospital, where, to use his own words, “I found every sick man in war paint.
My acting hospital sergeant said there was not much the matter with them;
they had heard there was to be a fight that night, and wanted to join the
party going, so I discharged them out of hospital. Canavan made no distinction;
the first fifty for duty were ordered to fall out, and in two hours
from the time we were warned we were on the march.” As Canavan and
his party were considered to be going on a forlorn hope, every European
not on duty was on the parade ground to wish the Royal Irish “good luck”
as they moved off, and the ladies were in tears, until their grief was changed
to mirth at the discovery that the doctor had filled his pouch, not with
medical appliances, but with revolver cartridges. Many of the garrison sat
up till dawn, listening anxiously for the burst of fire with which it was
feared the detachment would be overwhelmed. But no crash of musketry
broke the stillness of the night, and before Canavan reached Burhanpore
he learned the place had been reinforced by a larger column, with whose
movements the Commandant of Asseerghur was unacquainted, and that
Tantia Tope had disappeared. As no fighting was expected, Canavan was
ordered to return to his own post without delay&mdash;another instance of bad
luck, for in a day or two there was a sharp skirmish near Burhanpore, in
which his company would certainly have taken part.</p>

<p>In January, 1859, the greater part of the regiment was brought together
under Lieutenant-Colonel Call, and made many marches through the district
of Jaulna, vainly pursuing Rohilla freebooters who had no intention of
standing up to fight. As soon as these robber bands dispersed, the XVIIIth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
went back to garrison duty at detached posts, and in three or four months,
when the country had begun to settle down, most of the companies joined
headquarters at Sholapur, and then marched to Hyderabad in the Deccan,
which they reached on June 21, 1859. The muster roll shows that three
officers, Captain W. F. G. Forster, Lieutenant T. Watt, and Assistant-Surgeon
C. E. Porteous, and twenty-seven of the rank and file died of disease
during the Indian Mutiny campaign.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<span class="fs55">RAISING OF THE SECOND BATTALION: THE WAR IN NEW ZEALAND.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">After the Indian Mutiny a considerable increase in the strength of the army
was sanctioned by Parliament, for the reasons stated in <a href="#CHAPTER_X">chapter x.</a>, and additional
units of infantry were raised, not as new regiments but as second
battalions of existing organisations. The XVIIIth was one of the regiments
selected for this augmentation, and on March 25, 1858, forty-four years after
the original second battalion had been disbanded,<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> the nucleus of a new second
battalion was formed at Enniskillen by the transfer from the first battalion of
a hundred seasoned soldiers.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> A hundred and fifty men joined from the
Dublin City militia; other militia regiments contributed volunteers, and
recruits came in fast from the north of Ireland. For the first few months
of its existence the new battalion was in charge of Major A. W. S. F. Armstrong;
then Lieutenant-Colonel A. N. Campbell, on promotion from the first
battalion, assumed the command which he continued to hold until October,
1859, when he exchanged with Lieutenant-Colonel A. A. Chapman, 48th
regiment. In the same month the battalion was sent to England, and two
years later to the Channel Isles, where the detachment at Alderney did good
service in fighting a great fire which threatened to devastate the island.
Though the greater part of the rank and file was composed of growing lads,
“the ready and willing spirit displayed by all and their coolness under such
circumstances”<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> greatly impressed the local authorities. This incident proved,
if proof had been necessary, that the task of converting a mass of recruits
into trained and disciplined soldiers had been entrusted to good hands; and
early in 1863, the second battalion was considered to be fit for foreign service,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
and was selected to relieve one of the regiments then garrisoning New Zealand.
When the various detachments from Jersey, Guernsey, and Alderney had
concentrated at Parkhurst in the Isle of Wight, they were inspected by
Major-General Lord William Paulet, who in a complimentary speech commented
with pleasure on the great increase in the height of the men since he
had last seen the battalion eighteen months before.</p>

<p>On April 2, 1863, the headquarters and eight companies under command
of Lieutenant-Colonel Chapman sailed from Portsmouth in the ship <i>Elizabeth
Anne Bright</i>, followed on the 12th by the two service companies under
Brevet-Colonel G. J. Carey in the ship <i>Norwood</i>.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> The depôt companies were
stationed at Buttevant. After a prosperous and, for a sailing-ship, a rapid
voyage of ninety-one days, the <i>Elizabeth Anne Bright</i> on the 4th of July
reached Auckland, where three weeks later the <i>Norwood</i> arrived also. When
the leading ship dropped anchor, the Royal Irish learned that war had broken
out with the natives, and that the battalion was to take the field at once.
Before describing the part played by the XVIIIth in the campaign a short
account must be given of the Maoris, the enemy at whose hands the second
battalion was to receive its baptism of fire. According to native traditions,
New Zealand was peopled many centuries ago by an adventurous race (said
by ethnologists to be of Malay stock) who, swarming off from the Melanesian
archipelago, crossed the Southern Pacific in war canoes and landed in New
Zealand, which they named the Land of the Long White Cloud. Either the
country was uninhabited or the aborigines were easily conquered, for no trace
of their presence is found in Maori folklore. The newcomers first occupied
the coasts, and then gradually spread over the whole of the North and South
islands, forming clans which recognised no central authority and held all land
within their borders as the property not of individuals but of the tribe.
Between the tribes there was incessant strife, which hardened the Maoris into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
a nation of fighting men, skilled not only in every wile of savage warfare but
also, as we shall see, in the art of fortifying their strongholds.</p>

<p>The existence of the Maoris and the very position of the country they
inhabited remained unknown to Europeans until 1642, when Tasman, the
great Dutch navigator, sighted the Land of the Long White Cloud. His
government kept the information to themselves; and Captain Cook, a British
explorer even more celebrated than his Dutch forerunner, rediscovered New
Zealand in 1769, established friendly relations with the natives, and took
formal possession of the country for his sovereign, George III. But neither
at that time nor for many years later was England in the mood to develop
her new acquisition. Her conflict with the American colonists, her struggle
with the European coalition which supported their rebellion, and her gigantic
efforts to save the Continent of Europe from the domination of Napoleon, had
taxed her resources to the utmost; and it was not until seventy years after
Cook had annexed the country that definite official steps were taken to assert
British authority in New Zealand. But long before our Government decided
to occupy the islands, adventurous Britons had established themselves among
the Maoris. The penal settlement, formed towards the close of the eighteenth
century at Sydney, provided a port from which New Zealand became accessible
from the mainland of Australia, and a brisk trade gradually sprang up between
the natives and ship’s captains in timber, potatoes, and native flax. Nor were
these the only articles of commerce. Collectors of curiosities in Europe were
eager to possess specimens of the tattooing or face ornamentation for which
the Maoris were celebrated, and the heads of warriors, defeated and slain in
battle and preserved as trophies in the villages of the victors, were eagerly
exchanged for the muskets with which the white strangers were armed. By
degrees little settlements of Europeans grew up at various points along the
coast&mdash;each an Alsatia to which escaped convicts, deserters from the garrison
of Sydney, run-away sailors, riff-raff of every kind, sought a refuge from the
trammels of civilisation. Many of these wanderers threw in their lot with the
natives: some perished miserably; others were well treated and lived with the
Maoris for many years. A few of the survivors were men of some education,
and from their reminiscences, and those of the missionaries and pioneers who
arrived from England in the early “forties,” it is possible to form an idea
of the Maoris before they became tamed by British influence. Their character
as a nation was very complex. Though cannibals, and bloodthirsty to a
degree, their sense of honour was high, and their word once pledged was
considered inviolable. They were by no means devoid of chivalry; their
language was full of poetry; their manners were dignified; their laws were
well defined, and the tenure of land and the ownership of movable property
were regulated by customs, enforced by the power of the whole clan.</p>

<p>In the course of years the condition of the European settlements became a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
serious scandal; law and order were unknown, and there were constant
collisions between the natives and the Europeans, in which the white men
appear to have been frequently the aggressors. The Governor of New South
Wales, who was supposed to exercise a shadowy authority over the British in
New Zealand, reported strongly to the Colonial Office on the subject, and the
missionaries loudly complained that their efforts among the Maoris were
hampered by the presence of a considerable number of Europeans, whose
conduct was unrestrained by any form of government. In 1840, England
yielded to the pressure of public opinion and formally annexed New Zealand.
This step, ostensibly taken solely for the benefit of the Maoris, was also
influenced by political considerations, for the French had long desired to
establish themselves in the Southern Pacific: ever since the time of Cook
their ships had occasionally visited New Zealand, and it was known that
France was preparing to found a colony in the South island. An English
frigate, the <i>Druid</i>, sailed with the newly-appointed Governor about the same
time as <i>L’Aube</i>, a French man-of-war started in charge of a transport full of
emigrants for New Zealand. Our ship outstripped the French vessels, and
when <i>L’Aube</i> reached the South island her captain, to his bitter mortification,
found that the Union Jack had been hoisted forty-eight hours before!</p>

<p>The terms upon which New Zealand passed into the hands of the Crown
were almost unique in the history of England. Our possessions in the East
have been won by the sword in wars forced upon us by the lawlessness of the
neighbouring States. In America the presence of a large French garrison in
Canada and at the mouth of the St Lawrence was a thunder cloud constantly
overhanging the New England colonies until we captured Quebec in the
Seven Years’ War. In the southern hemisphere Australia was a no-man’s land&mdash;a
wilderness inhabited only by a few tribes of degraded savages. The
necessity of defending the colonists in South Africa against the attacks of
marauding Kaffirs has caused the gradual extension of British rule from Cape
Town on the Atlantic to Zululand on the Indian Ocean. But in New
Zealand the chiefs were treated as our equals when, at the solemn treaty of
Waitanga in 1840, they ceded on behalf of their clans the sovereignty of their
territories to Queen Victoria, and accepted her protection, and with it all the
rights and privileges of British subjects.</p>

<p>For several years after this treaty was made the country seemed
thoroughly quiet: large numbers of emigrants arrived from England and
prospered greatly in their new homes; and the majority of Maoris appeared
to acquiesce in our presence. Some of the clans were glad to be saved from
internecine strife; others appreciated the increased demand for their staple
productions of flax and timber, which was one of the results of the European
influx; but others again, especially the tribes in the centre of the North island,
grew dissatisfied with the new order of things, and elected a king to rule over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
them, who established a capital at Ngaruawahia, a strategic point at the
junction of the Waikato and Waipa rivers.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> From a mistaken policy of non-intervention
this movement was not put down, and it rapidly degenerated
into openly expressed antagonism towards the settlers. In 1862, to quote the
words of one of the Ministers of the Crown, it “presented the following
features:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“An elected king, a very young man of no force of character,
surrounded by a few ambitious chiefs who formed a little mock court,
and by a body-guard who kept him from all vulgar contact and from
even the inspection of Europeans, except on humiliating terms; entirely
powerless to enforce among his subjects the decisions of his magistrates;
an army, if it might be called so, of 5000 to 10,000 followers scattered over
the country, but organised so that large numbers could be concentrated
at any one point on short notice; large accumulated supplies of food,
of arms and ammunition; a position in the centre of the island from
which a descent could be made in a few hours on any of the European
settlements; roads prohibited to be made through two-thirds of the
island; the large rivers barred against steamers so that nine-tenths of
the country was closed against the ordinary means of travel and transport;
the Queen’s law set at utter defiance; her magistrates treated
with supercilious contempt; her writs torn to pieces and trampled under
foot; Europeans who had married native women driven out of the King’s
districts, while their wives and children were taken from them, unless
they would recognise and pay an annual tribute to the King; all this
accompanied by an exhibition of the utmost arrogance and undisguised
contempt for the power of the Queen, the Governor and the Europeans.”<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p></div>

<p>The safety of the colony was threatened seriously by these sullenly rebellious
tribes; and when in 1863, a body of the King’s followers intervened in a
dispute between Maoris and Europeans in the south-west of the North island,
war became inevitable. The King’s party, which was largely composed of
the Waikato tribe, planned to open the campaign by raiding Auckland and
exterminating its white inhabitants. Lieutenant-General Sir Duncan A.
Cameron, who was in command of the Imperial troops in New Zealand, and
Sir George Grey, the Governor of the colony, decided to anticipate the Maoris
by advancing upon their strongholds in the wild country south of the
Waikato. This river rises in the centre of the North island and winds its
way northwards from its source to within forty miles of Auckland, when it
turns sharply to the south-west at the native village of Te Ta. Here a
tributary, the Mangatawhari creek, joins it from the north-east, and the two
streams marked the northern limit of the district held by the followers of the
King. Civilisation had spread about twenty-five miles to the south of Auckland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
and a metalled road ran past scores of prosperous farms, tangible proofs
of the success which had attended the colonists in this part of New Zealand.
At the village of Drury the good road was replaced by a rough and narrow
track, which winding through a broad belt of bush known as the Hunua
forest, crossed very undulating country much cut up by deep ravines, half
buried in ferns and scrub. This dense forest, which a series of almost
impenetrable thickets rendered ideal for Maori offensive tactics, was to be
the scene of many skirmishes in which detachments of the XVIIIth greatly
distinguished themselves.</p>

<p>The arrival of the Royal Irish brought up the number of regular battalions
in New Zealand to seven;<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> but by no means all of these were available for
the front. It was necessary to keep up the strength of the detachments in
various parts of both islands; the line of communication absorbed a great
quantity of fighting men, and garrisons had to be provided for the settlers in
lonely hamlets and isolated farms. Though at one time during the war the
armed whites in the colony reached the respectable total of 15,000 men,
the greatest force of regular and volunteer troops actually under the hand
of the General at any time appears never to have exceeded two thousand five
hundred. To form an accurate estimate of the numbers against us is impossible,
for many tribes remained neutral, others were on our side, while
others again took but a fitful part in the operations and preferred to plunder
settlers rather than to meet soldiers in the field. One point, however, seems
quite clear; on every occasion when there was serious fighting we greatly
out-numbered our savage but very gallant foes.</p>

<p>As soon as the Royal Irish landed they were sent to Otahuhu, a camp
a little to the south of Auckland, where General Cameron was concentrating
his troops. Here the battalion received their campaigning kit: officers and
men were provided with blue serge “jumpers,” haversacks, water-bottles and
pannikins: all ranks carried a blanket and <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'waterpoof sheet'">waterproof sheet</ins>, rolled, and slung
over the left shoulder; the men were armed with Enfield rifles and bayonets.
Five days later the column marched through Drury to the Queen’s redoubt,
a work which commanded the crossing of the Waikato at Te Ta. A detachment
of two hundred of the XVIIIth, under Captain Inman, was dropped at
Drury to hold that post on the line of communication, and a few days later
the whole of the battalion appears to have been echeloned along the bush track
between Drury and the Queen’s redoubt. On hearing that Cameron was
in motion the Maoris divided their forces: one column was to hold the
British at the Waikato while the other was to turn Cameron’s left, harass his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
communications, and if possible swoop upon Auckland. It was with the
enemy’s right wing that the Royal Irish were chiefly engaged for the first
few months of the war, but before giving an account of their doings it is
necessary to sketch very briefly the operations south of the Waikato.</p>

<p>On July 12, 1863, Cameron crossed the river and dislodged the enemy from
the heights of Koheroa above the Mangatawhari creek. He was, however,
unable to follow up this initial success; for nearly three months difficulties
of land transport, the want of steamers of sufficiently light draught for river
work, and the activity of the Maoris on his rear prevented further movements
against the series of works which at various points commanded the right bank
of the Waikato. The military genius of the Maoris and its limitations were
alike revealed in these fortifications, in which the system of defence evolved
by a long series of inter-tribal conflicts had been cleverly adapted to new
conditions of war. Before firearms were introduced into New Zealand, the</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“Maoris’ <em>pahs</em>, or stockaded and entrenched villages, usually perched
on cliffs and jutting points overhanging river or sea, were defended by a
double palisade, the outer fence of stout stakes, the inner of high solid
trunks. Between them was a shallow ditch. Platforms as much as forty
feet high supplied coigns of vantage for the look-out. Thence, too, darts
and stones could be hurled at the besiegers. With the help of a throwing
stick, or rather whip, wooden spears could be thrown in the sieges more
than a hundred yards. Ignorant of the bow and arrow, and the
boomerang, the Maoris knew and used the sling; with it red-hot stones
would be hurled over the palisades among the rush-thatched huts of an
assaulted village, a stratagem all the more difficult to cope with as Maori
<em>pahs</em> seldom contained wells or springs of water.”<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p></div>

<p>In the series of skirmishes dignified by the name of the Maori war of
1860-61 the natives had carefully studied our tactics and our weapons; and in
the war of 1863-66, in order to bring into play the muskets and double-barrelled
guns with which they were armed, and to minimise the effect of our
rifle and shell fire, they selected positions open in front, with flanks resting on
rivers, swamps, or impenetrable bush. They made great use of earthworks
and of redoubts, square or oblong in shape, flanked at opposite angles by
bastions and surrounded by ditches, in some cases twelve feet wide and
measuring eighteen feet from the bottom of the ditch to the top of the
parapet. Pushed out to the front and flanks were two or three tiers of rifle-pits
or short trenches, connected by sunk roads with each other and with the
main work. The marksmen in these pits were often protected by head cover,
made of trunks of trees or of hurdles thatched with fern and covered deep
with earth; and to break the force of a bayonet charge, stout palisades were
sometimes built in front of the rifle-pits with spaces left for grazing fire to
sweep over the glacis. Yet though this system of fortification showed that to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
their natural cleverness the Maoris added the power of rapidly absorbing
new ideas, their intelligence failed them in one essential particular. In the
selection of a position they never realised the importance of a good water-supply,
and when an attack was threatened they neglected to store their
works with water, trusting to their young men to bring in by night the
quantity required for the next day’s consumption. Thus after a close investment
of a few days they had no alternative but to cut their way out or to
surrender.</p>

<p>While General Cameron was waiting for his river steamers, a rumour
reached the Maoris at Meri-Meri, the position nearest to Cameron’s encampment,
that the General and his soldiers were short of food. Under a flag of
truce the Chiefs sent down the river a little fleet of canoes laden with potatoes
and milch-goats as a present to the British troops. This was by no means an
isolated instance of native chivalry, for, to use the slang of the present day,
the Maoris were “sportsmen,” and always said that there was no glory in
fighting hungry men. When at length the arrival of river craft enabled
Cameron to move, he threatened the front of the works of Meri-Meri with five
hundred men, among whom were a detachment of Royal Irish, while a turning
party of rather greater strength, in barges mounted with Armstrong guns,
was towed to a landing-place in rear of the enemy’s works. The Maoris did
not await the attack, but fled southwards across country which recent rains
had made impassable for Europeans. Cameron occupied their position, which
the detachment of the XVIIIth fortified under the direction of the Royal
Engineers. In November the General took an important step towards freeing
the line of communication from the natives who harassed his convoys in the
Hunua forest and ravaged the farms in the neighbourhood of Auckland.
Many of these guerillas came from the country round the estuary of the
Thames river, and thither he sent an expedition under Brevet-Colonel Carey,
XVIIIth regiment, to overawe the district and establish a line of blockhouses
between the Thames and the Waikato. While Carey was carrying out his
mission successfully Cameron pushed up the river, and on November 20th,
attacked the formidable works at Rangiriri, the Maoris’ second position on the
Waikato. Before the enemy had been thoroughly shaken by artillery the
order was given for the assault, and though repeated and gallant charges were
delivered, the troops that day achieved but a partial success, bought at the
cost of 132 casualties. Under cover of the night several hundred of the
enemy escaped; the remainder, 183 in number, surrendered at daybreak and
were made prisoners of war. In this engagement the Royal Irish were
represented only by one officer, Captain and Brevet-Lieutenant-Colonel Sir H.
Havelock, V.C.,<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> then serving on the headquarter staff as D.A.Q.M.G., and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
few men. The losses at Rangiriri greatly dispirited the enemy, who allowed
Cameron to march unmolested up the right bank of the Waikato, and on
December 9, 1863, to occupy Ngaruawahia, the capital of the rebellious
country.</p>

<p>The Royal Irish were hard at work on the line of communication during
this time. Tracks had to be cut through virgin forest and garrisons provided
for settlers’ farms; convoys needed large escorts, while the road along which
the waggons lumbered had to be strongly piquetted and constantly patrolled.
In these duties detachments of the XVIIIth met with many exciting
adventures; they alternately rescued parties of other regiments from
imminent danger or were themselves saved from destruction by the timely
arrival of reinforcements. Many laurels were won in these skirmishes, of
which the details, as far as they have been preserved, are here recorded.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> Six
days after the headquarters of the battalion had reached the Queen’s redoubt
Captain Ring, with Ensign Bicknell, two sergeants, and forty-seven rank and
file, was sent in charge of a convoy to Drury. The track passed through a
forest, thus described by an officer of great experience of campaigning in the
forests of many parts of the British Empire: “The bush of New Zealand is
wonderfully dense and entangled. A European going into it about twenty
yards and turning round three times is quite at a loss to find his way out
again unless he is somewhat of an Indian path-finder and can judge of the
points of the compass by the bark of the trees, the sun, &amp;c. Trying to run
through the bush one is tripped up by the supplejack and other creepers.”<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>
While on the march Ring fell into an ambuscade of about 140 Maoris; fire
was opened by invisible enemies upon his advance-guard, his right flank, and
his rear; a driver and two horses in the centre of the convoy fell wounded;
the line of waggons was thrown into confusion, and the Maoris attacked his
left flank. He retired immediately with as many men as he could concentrate,
and, in skirmishing order, kept the enemy at bay for some time; then seeing
himself nearly surrounded he retreated into a settler’s farm, which he held
until some of Inman’s detachment at Drury extricated him from his dangerous
situation. In this affair four men were killed and ten wounded.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>Soon after this affair Ring found himself in charge of a mixed body of
troops at Keri-Keri, on the road which runs north-east from Drury through
the Wairoa country to the coast. With him were five officers and about two
hundred rank and file of the battalion, and two officers and a hundred men of
a New Zealand militia regiment. In the morning of the 22nd of July he
learned that a number of natives had murderously attacked two settlers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
and immediately afterwards heard heavy firing about two miles off near
Pukekewereke, where sixteen volunteers were defending themselves against
very heavy odds. Leaving the militia and two officers and a hundred of his
own men to hold the post, he hurried to the rescue with Lieutenant Wray,
Ensigns Jackson and Butts, and the remainder of the Royal Irish. On
reaching the scene of the skirmish Ring opened fire, and, to use the words
of his report, “the natives retreated to my former entrenchment above the
<em>wharé</em><a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> at Keri-Keri; the fire of the skirmishers drove them down the side of
the hill into the brushwood; the leading skirmishers on the right, under
Lieutenant Wray, took possession of the hill and kept up fire on them; I, with
another body of skirmishers, proceeding to take that on the right flank, but
found that the natives, who mustered a strong force, nearly surrounded me;
here I lost a man killed, whose rifle and bayonet were taken possession of by
the natives, though not without serious loss to them. I then concentrated my
men on the entrenchment, and having heard from a Royal Artillery officer
who rode up to my position that the 65th regiment was in my immediate
vicinity, I requested that he would inform the officer commanding the 65th
that there was a track in the enemy’s rear, and that if an attack were made
in that direction it would be of great service. As it was quite impossible for
me to follow so strong a force of the enemy into the bush with my small force,
I remained in the entrenched position until close on sunset, keeping a steady
fire on the enemy, who were endeavouring to obtain the body of the private
who was killed and whom I would not leave. I repeatedly tried to obtain
possession of the body by sending out volunteers of the man’s company, but
desisted, finding it would entail greater loss. I was about to retire, leaving a
rear-guard in the entrenchment, when the mounted artillery arrived.” The
gunners were closely followed by a party of the 65th, who threw themselves
into the fray with great spirit. On the appearance of these fresh troops the
natives drew off into bush so thick that no pursuit was possible, and after
the body of the dead soldier had been recovered the whole force returned to
their entrenchments. This affair cost the battalion one man killed and four
wounded.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> For Ring’s conduct and good judgment on this occasion General
Cameron recommended him for a brevet-majority, to which he had been
gazetted in England before he fell mortally wounded at the engagement of
Orakau on March 31, 1864. The detachment was commended for the firmness
with which they had held their ground against superior numbers.</p>

<p>The next time any of the XVIIIth were in action seems to have been on
the 25th of August. The attack on Ring’s convoy had shown how easily
traffic could be stopped in the Hunua forest. To make communication safer
through this belt of bush the Government of New Zealand set a large number
of men to cut down the scrub on either side of the road. Soldiers as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
civilians were employed on the work; among the former were a party of
a corps which appears not only to have been ignorant of the first
principles of warfare, but grossly disobedient to orders. General Cameron
had officially reminded the troops that axe-men should always be protected
by a covering party; but the detachment disregarded this order and, far
from taking precautions for their safety, piled arms near the road under
charge of a single sentry. The Maoris crawled through the bush, rushed the
sentry, and before the detachment could regain their rifles nearly all the
arms had fallen into the enemy’s hands. Several of the &mdash;&mdash; were hit; the
remainder, defenceless without their rifles, had fallen back for shelter into
the forest, when the guard of a convoy, chiefly composed of a company
of the Royal Irish, under Captain R. P. Bishopp, appeared on the scene, and
after an hour’s sharp skirmishing succeeded in driving away the enemy. In
this affair one man of the XVIIIth was wounded.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> Early in September the
headquarters of the Royal Irish were moved to Drury, leaving two companies
under Captain Noblett to man the Queen’s redoubt. During the month three
detachments of the battalion had brushes with the enemy. Half a mile from
the village of Pokeno, near the Queen’s redoubt, a party of 62 non-commissioned
officers and men, under Ensign C. Dawson, were attacked by a body
of natives, who fired into them from the rear. A bayonet charge drove the
enemy into a gully, down which the Royal Irish pursued them for half a
mile, when a burst of war-whoops and yells from the village warned Dawson
to collect his men to meet a fresh danger. Making his way back to Pokeno,
he was received by a volley from Maoris hidden among the stumps and logs
of timber in a clearing in front of the village, and from another party on his
left flank. Dawson had his men well in hand, kept them in skirmishing
order, and maintained a steady fire from all available cover, until he was
extricated from this unpleasant situation by the arrival of a party of the
40th, and later by a further reinforcement, the escort to a convoy commanded
by Captain Noblett, XVIIIth regiment. The Maoris fled before the
levelled bayonets of the combined detachments and took refuge in the bush,
into which the soldiers could not follow. A few days later, a convoy in
charge of a body of volunteers broke down at Pukekohe, near Drury; some
of the Royal Irish, under Captain Inman, were sent to its assistance, and
found the waggons stuck in deep mud, while the Maoris were attacking the
stockade which contained the garrison of the post. Inman’s party rescued
the convoy; then, reinforced by the volunteers, they went in with the cold
steel, and received praise from General Cameron for “the gallant manner in
which they charged the enemy, driving him back into the bush with severe
loss from the position he had taken up near the stockade.” For his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
services on this and other occasions Captain Inman received a Brevet-Majority.</p>

<p>About the same time another party of the XVIIIth were in action on the
Wairoa road, along which various blockhouses had been built to cover the
approach to Auckland. One of these works, the Galloway redoubt, was in
charge of Major Lyon, an ex-imperial officer, under whose orders some of the
battalion were placed. On the 15th of September the Maoris attacked the
redoubt, but were beaten off, after an affair in which the steadiness of the
Royal Irish was conspicuous. Two days later Lyon, who had been reinforced
by another party of the XVIIIth under Lieutenant Russell, took the offensive,
and under cover of darkness led his troops towards Otau, a native village
occupied by local insurgents. It was found to be on the far side of a river,
and while Lyon searched for a ford, he engaged the enemy with musketry&mdash;according
to a well-known historian, with unexpectedly important results&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Across the stream at early dawn a detachment of the XVIIIth
regiment poured concentrated fire upon the <em>wharés</em> [huts]. They did not
know that within them was a band of Maoris, who had come to join the
fighting, and who, under the volleys poured upon the huts, fell like
sheep. The troops, unable to cross the stream, withdrew, unconscious
of what they had done. Major Lyon, who made a circuit by a bridge,
found the settlement deserted. ‘The <em>wharés</em>,’ he said, ‘were riddled with
shot, blood in profusion both inside and out. They were unmistakably
taken by surprise.’ In after years a Maori who was present told how
extensive was the slaughter unwittingly inflicted by the XVIIIth, who
exercised themselves by firing at the huts without knowing how they
were occupied. As the wounded and dead were carried away before
Major Lyon reached the spot, he also was ignorant of the severity of the
blow inflicted.”<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p></div>

<p>In October, the battalion were again fortunate enough to rescue a party of
New Zealand volunteers from a dangerous situation. An officer of the irregulars
while reconnoitring a large body of natives near his post at Manku, was
drawn into an engagement, forced back into his stockade, and closely surrounded.
The news reached Drury in the evening, and a strong party of the
XVIIIth under Captain Noblett was at once sent, with some of the 70th, to
the relief of the volunteers. Pushing on throughout the night the troops
early in the morning reached Manku, from which the Maoris decamped
promptly, thus depriving the Royal Irish of the excitement of a skirmish.
They at once returned to Drury, where they arrived after twenty-two hours’
continuous marching. At the end of the month two companies in charge
of Captain Noblett reinforced Ring’s post in the Wairoa country; and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
November an expedition, largely composed of the Royal Irish, was sent to
avenge outrages committed on the settlers in this district. The marauders
had stockaded themselves in a position surrounded by dense bush, swamps,
and precipitous ravines, but after a skirmish the <em>pah</em> was captured and
destroyed.</p>

<p>In war opportunities of distinction do not come to every officer, and
such in a marked degree was the case in New Zealand, where much good
work was done by some of the officers of the XVIIIth whose names do not
appear in General Cameron’s reports. Though the vigorous action of the
troops on the line of communication and in the Wairoa country prevented the
Maoris from raiding Auckland itself, it was impossible for Cameron with the
small number of men at his disposal to carry the war into the enemy’s country,
and at the same time protect all the outlying farms cleared in the bush by
enterprising settlers. In most cases the colonists abandoned their farms, sent
their women and children to Auckland, and turned themselves into a militia,
which proved a valuable asset in the British force. Occasionally, however,
the entire population of a settlement held its ground, and required help from
the troops. Thus, in September, Captain Kemp<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> with 150 of the Royal
Irish was sent to the relief of one of these outposts of civilisation; a forced
march through virgin forest, past many farms which the Maoris had looted
and burned to the ground, brought him to his destination, where he found the
colonists had thrown up stockades round their tiny church, in peaceful times
used by various denominations as a place of worship, but now turned into the
keep of the primitive fortress. Leaving these brave pioneers a supply of
provisions and cartridges, and a small party of troops to give backbone to the
defence, he returned to Drury, where his next duty was to form a post at
a deserted farm on the line of communication. With his own company and
fifty men under Lieutenant Briggs he cut down tree ferns, and with their
trunks, lashed together with wild vines (locally known as supplejack), built a
strong palisade, eight feet in height, enclosing not only the farm buildings
but also space enough for the tents of his detachment. As soon as the
farm had been placed in a state of defence, the British instinct of cleanliness
asserted itself, and the house and outbuildings were thoroughly cleansed;
then parties of men were sent out to “round up” the farmer’s cattle which
had strayed into the forest, while others improved the defences and escorted
the convoys to the next post on the way to the front. Encouraged by the
presence of the detachment the farmer returned with his family to his
house, which can hardly be described as a peaceful home, for, to quote
Captain Kemp’s diary, “Our nights were disturbed by seeing lights in
the bush. I burned all the low scrub (near the farm), and twice a-week<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
took out a skirmishing party and scoured the forest: we saw a few
natives but they always escaped us in the thick undergrowth. However
we were not further molested.” Kemp’s diary then briefly records a succession
of escorts to convoys and to prisoners taken at the fight of Rangariri;
much road-making, and marches knee-deep in swamps.</p>

<p>In January, 1864, the Royal Irish were employed in various ways.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> Part
of the battalion was sent to guard the line of communication from the
Queen’s redoubt southward to Ngaruawahia; the remainder formed the
garrisons of the chain of works which Brevet-Colonel Carey had established
between the Waikato and the estuary of the Thames. Thanks to
Captain Kemp, we know something of the hard work done by those of
the XVIIIth who were in charge of these posts. On the 7th of January, with
two hundred men, he</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“marched to the Surrey redoubt; it was very hot as we skirted the
swamps and many men fainted from the heat. We placed a detachment
in the redoubt, slept in the open outside it, and marched at 5.30
<span class="fs70">A.M.</span> next day eight miles to the Esk redoubt on high ground in open
fern-covered country. Here I left Briggs and a detachment and took
my company down to the Miranda redoubt, four miles farther on,
situated at the edge of a steep cliff overlooking the estuary of the
Thames and defended by a small river on the north side. Here I had
command of two hundred men, one half being Waikato militia. We
enlarged the redoubt and made a road down to the landing-place
(previously all stores were dragged up the face of the cliff and the
Commissariat suffered heavy losses). We made a floating bridge over
the small river, sunk a well for drinking water, and built a small
redoubt on the approach from the south in which a strong piquet was
posted at night. Boats being unable to come in at low water we
made a causeway across the mud flats to a deep-water landing-place.... We
were annoyed at first by spies and small parties of the enemy at
night, so I sent out scouring parties and destroyed their villages, bringing
in large quantities of beautiful peaches, potatoes, and other vegetables.”</p></div>

<p>At the end of January, General Cameron had accumulated enough stores
at Ngaruawahia to warrant his advancing farther to the southward. He
therefore worked up the right bank of the Waipa, building and garrisoning
redoubts as he advanced, and in a few days reached the village of Te Rore,
where for nearly three weeks he was brought to a halt&mdash;not by the enemy,
but by the eternal difficulty of supply and transport. Shoals in the rivers
made water-carriage uncertain, and though the crews of the little steamers,
the flat-bottomed row-boats, and the other craft specially built for the expedition
did their best, this mode of transport was always liable to break<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
down. By land things were no better. In the plain between the Waikato
and Waipa rivers there were hardly any roads, and the native paths, winding
through forests of tree ferns, were so narrow that men could only march
in single file. These paths crossed innumerable creeks running in deep watercourses,
impassable for guns or waggons till roads had been cut down the
steep banks and bridges thrown over the streams. The difficulty of keeping
supplied even the small number of men&mdash;less than 2500&mdash;who were concentrated
at Te Rore was enormous, for though Cameron’s headquarters were
only eighty miles from his base at Auckland, every box of “stores had to
be shifted twelve or fourteen times on account of changes of land and water
carriage.”<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> To relieve this strain Cameron cut a road through the bush
to Raglan, a port twenty miles distant on the west coast, and thus gained
a second or subsidiary base, but as a set-off to this advantage a considerable
number of men were necessarily withdrawn from active operations to
guard the new line of communication.</p>

<p>While the advance depôt at Te Rore was being gradually filled up, the
Maoris threw up a formidable chain of works to bar farther advance into
their country; but after a few skirmishes they were manœuvred from these
positions and disappeared into the mountains in the centre of the island.
To prevent their return down the Waikato river, a post was formed on its
left bank at Pukerima, and manned by the headquarter companies of the
XVIIIth from Ngaruawahia. The stay of the battalion at the Maori capital
had been uneventful, though to celebrate the temporary reunion of most
of the companies pony races and sports for the men were organised, and
made a welcome break in the monotony of the campaign, for in the long
intervals between active operations amusements for all ranks were not to
be obtained. An officer writes: “There were very few opportunities during
the war for gymkhanas and that sort of thing, and a ‘sing-song’ over the
camp-fire was as much as could be attempted. Occasionally a little duck-shooting
from canoes was obtainable if we were stationed near a river, or
more rarely a raid on the semi-wild boar sometimes to be met with in the
bush. Pigeon-shooting was sometimes to be had, but this was about all.”</p>

<p>Not all the companies went with headquarters to the new post; some
held the works on the lower reaches of the river, and a detachment of
four companies under Captain Ring was at Te Awamutu, where Colonel
Carey, recently promoted to be Brigadier-General and second-in-command
of the forces in New Zealand, was throwing up strong redoubts. Here
everything appeared to be quiet until a scouting party of colonists discovered
that a number of Maoris had slipped back to the Waikato plain,
and were vigorously entrenching themselves a few miles off near the native
village of Orakau. Carey at once reconnoitred the <em>pah</em>, and decided to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
move on the enemy’s position during the night; the main column was to
advance on Orakau,<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> while smaller parties were to place themselves by
forced marches on the enemy’s flank and rear. Like a good soldier, Carey
did not issue his orders till the last moment, and it was not till after
dark on the 30th of March that the officers of the detachment of the XVIIIth
heard the news, which reached them in a very dramatic manner. They
were sitting at mess in a native hut, dimly lighted by a few camp lanterns,
when the voice of a staff officer was heard calling for Ring, who in a few
minutes returned, looking pale and depressed. Waiting until the soldier
servants had left the hut to reply to his comrades’ inquiries as to the
cause of his sudden gloom, he explained that the detachment was to march
that night to attack the <em>pah</em>, and he added in confidence that he had a
presentiment that his last hour was close at hand. “I have taken part in
many affairs of this kind,” he said, “but I have never felt as I do now.”
When his friends “chaffed” him and tried to cheer him up, he answered,
“Oh! never fear. I’ll do my duty.” After issuing the necessary orders to
the detachment he wrote his farewell letters, hastily put his affairs in
order, and then marched off with the advance-guard, which he had the
honour on this occasion to command.</p>

<p>The column reached Orakau at dawn on March 31. The Maoris, though
evidently taken by surprise, opened fire on the advance-guard, composed
of 120 Royal Irish and a party of 20 men of an irregular corps, known as
the Forest Rangers. Ring extended his men into skirmishing order, and,
supported by a company of the 40th, led them to the attack. The position,
which apparently had not been reconnoitred adequately, proved very formidable.
On a swelling down the Maoris had thrown up an “earthwork with
good flank defences, deep ditches, with posts and rails outside, and nearly
covered from view by flax-bushes, peach-trees, and high fern.”<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> Though
repulsed by the fire of their unseen enemies Ring’s men re-formed quickly,
and reinforced by a second company of the 40th, made another but equally
futile effort to storm the works, being again beaten back with the loss of
several officers and men, among whom was Brevet-Major Ring, mortally
wounded. When Captain Baker, XVIIIth, D.A.A.G., saw that Ring was
down, he flung himself off his horse, and calling for volunteers led a third
assault. This failed also, but though these three attacks were unsuccessful,
they served their purpose by so completely occupying the attention of the
enemy that he did not realise that the British troops were hemming him
in on every side; and though the cordon was at first but slender it sufficed
to prevent reinforcements from throwing themselves into the <em>pah</em>. At midday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
a large party of Maoris tried to break through our lines from the outside,
but a few shells and the musketry of the outposts kept them at a respectful
distance, unable to do more than excite their besieged comrades to further
resistance by shouts and war dances. As soon as the detached columns
detailed to surround the <em>pah</em> were in their places, Carey began to sap up
to the works, covering his movements with artillery fire. In defending
themselves against this bombardment the Maoris showed great resource.
“Long bundles of fern were cut and bound with strips of green flax until
an enormous mass of yielding fern received the harmless cannon-balls and
guarded the earthworks.”<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>Throughout the afternoon and night the besieged kept up a heavy fire
upon the troops, who “dug themselves in” so effectually with their bayonets
that the casualties were few. The sap was pushed on vigorously, and on the
1st of April various small reinforcements, snatched up from the line of communication,
reached Carey. Among them was a party of the XVIIIth under
Captain Inman, composed of 1 captain, 2 subalterns, 8 sergeants, 2 drummers,
and 110 rank and file, and 70 officers and men of the 70th; after marching
all night, they were sent at once into the trenches and rifle-pits with
which the <em>pah</em> was being rapidly encircled. Though the enemy kept up
a heavy fire upon the men digging in the sap, the work went on without
intermission until the morning of the 2nd, when Lieutenant-Colonel Havelock
brought into camp a quantity of hand-grenades, which a brave artilleryman,
at the risk of his life, hurled into the enemy’s rifle-pits. Under cover of the
confusion produced by these missiles Carey ran into the sap a 6-pr. Armstrong
gun, whose fire breached the palisades, and beat down the musketry directed
upon the working-parties. The situation had improved so much that he was
preparing to assault, when General Cameron ordered him to stay his hand. The
General had recently arrived on the scene, but not wishing to deprive Carey
of his command announced that he was present as a spectator only; learning,
however, that many women and children were in the <em>pah</em>, he desired that
the garrison should be given the chance to surrender before the attack was
pressed home. The condition of the Maoris was now desperate. When
surprised by our sudden swoop on Orakau, they had little or no water in
the <em>pah</em>; our line of outposts and rifle-pits proved impenetrable to the
parties who sought for water in the night; their only food was raw potatoes;
their losses in fighting men had been considerable, and their supply of bullets
was almost exhausted. Yet they disdained to yield, and when an interpreter
addressed them, saying, “Hear the word of the General: you have done
enough to show that you are brave men; your case is hopeless; surrender,
and your lives will be spared;” they haughtily replied, “This is the word
of the Maori: we will fight for ever and ever and ever.” They were then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
invited to send away the women, and answered, “The women will fight as
well as we.”</p>

<p>After this abortive negotiation fire was reopened on both sides, and some
of the troops appear to have lost their heads and attempted to storm the
<em>pah</em> without orders.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> One of these unauthorised assaults was led by a soldier
in the XVIIIth, Private Hannon, who, throwing his forage cap over a partially
breached spot in the defences, dashed after it with some twenty men,
for the most part belonging to New Zealand corps. After clambering over a
stout fence they dropped into a ditch, where Hannon and nine other brave
men were mown down by a volley fired at point-blank range. But though a
similar attack by a party of regulars and volunteers also failed to carry
another weak spot in the fortifications, every hour saw the Maoris less
able to face the storm of grape-shot, hand-grenades, and rifle-bullets poured
upon them on every side. Suddenly Rewi, their war chief, decided to cut his
way out or to perish in the attempt. While his followers mustered among
the huts round which their works were built, they sang one of the
hymns taught them by the missionaries, and then, remembering the old days
before white men had settled in New Zealand, chanted invocations to their
ancient gods.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Their voices,” says Rusden, “were heard by the wondering English,
who were to marvel still more at their daring. At the rear a double
line of the investing troops had been thrown back under cover to enable
a gun to open fire. Through that opening, about four o’clock in the
broad day, chanting their appeal to the God of battles and moving
steadily as in scorn of their foes, the Maoris marched towards the narrow
neck of swamp between the ridge and mound. Carey (in his official
report) said they rushed. Mr Fox writes that an eye-witness told him
‘they were in a great column, the women, the children, and the great
chiefs in the centre, and they marched out as cool and steady as if they
had been going to Church.’ Rewi ordered that no shot should be fired.
The little ammunition left was needed for defence in the desperate
course through the swamp.... Some accounts state that as if to deceive
the troops and gain time for the fugitives, a Maori, while his countrymen
departed, sprang up with a white flag on the parapet and was riddled
by bullets. One chief, more successful, diverted the English for a few
moments; he walked coolly towards the troops and surrendered.”<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p></div>

<p>The regiment (not the XVIIIth) charged with the defence of the ground
across which the Maori column was moving, was disposed in two lines, the
foremost lying under a bank which, while it covered the men from fire from
the <em>pah</em>, prevented their watching the ground in front of them. The Maoris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
marched towards this bank, and, incredible as it seems, passed through these
two lines of British regular troops, apparently without opposition. It was
rumoured at the time that before the men in the first line discovered that the
natives were out of their trenches, the Maoris had actually jumped over their
heads and were well on their way towards the second line! Thanks to the
energy of the General and his staff and the zeal of the remainder of the
troops, the natives did not escape in a body, but were headed off by a handful
of mounted men, who punished them severely in a pursuit which lasted until
nightfall. Thirty-three prisoners fell into our hands; more than a hundred
bodies were found on the field; it was known that at least twenty men had
been buried in the <em>pah</em>, while traces in the bush proved that a considerable
number of killed and wounded had been carried away after the troops had
been recalled to camp. The natives themselves acknowledged to a loss of
two hundred, out of a strength considered by General Cameron not to exceed
three hundred fighting men. Well might the British General in his despatch
say that it was impossible not to admire the heroic courage and devotion of
the Maoris in defending themselves so long against overwhelming numbers.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>When the Royal Irish were let loose, the men were wild to avenge the
death of Captain Ring, who was deservedly respected and admired by all
ranks in the regiment. Though the officers did all they could to prevent
unnecessary slaughter, more than one Maori was slain in the belief that it
was he who had fired the shot which laid Ring low. When a fugitive was
overtaken the cry arose, “That’s the man that killed the Captain!”&mdash;then
came a wild yell, a bayonet thrust, and all was over. Not all the XVIIIth,
however, were believers in such stern methods: two instances of clemency
are recorded, one of which unhappily ended fatally to the poor Irishman. A
soldier overtook and seized a Maori and spared his life; the prisoner was
lying on the ground exhausted and apparently harmless, and his captor had
turned away for a moment, when the native seized a rifle and shot him dead.
The savage’s triumph was short-lived, however, for other men of the XVIIIth
were on the spot and silenced him for ever. In the other case there was no
such tragedy. Early in the pursuit a Maori was taken prisoner and placed
in the charge of two privates, who, as they heard the shouts of their comrades
dying away in the distance, cursed their bad luck in being obliged to remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
behind. An officer came up when their impatience reached its climax, and
overheard this conversation. “Shall we kill him, Barney?” Barney thought
for a moment, and then shook his head. “I couldn’t kill the craytur in cold
blood, Pat, but I wish we were quit of him.” “Kick him and let him go,”
was the ready response. No sooner said than done; the prisoner disappeared
into the bush, while Pat and Barney hurried after the regiment!</p>

<p>The British losses were sixteen killed and fifty-two wounded. The
casualties among the Royal Irish were one officer (Brevet-Major Ring) and
eight of the other ranks killed or mortally wounded, nine non-commissioned
officers and men wounded.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> In his official report Brigadier-General Carey,
after expressing his deep regret at the death of Brevet-Major Ring, brought
the services of Captain Inman to the notice of the General Officer commanding
in New Zealand.</p>

<p>After the capture of Orakau the enemy retired again into the mountains,
whither Cameron did not deem it prudent to follow him; and when the
disaffected tribes in other parts of the North island heard how inconclusively
the campaign on the Waikato had ended, there was an insurrection in the east,
chiefly memorable for our defeat at the Gate <em>pah</em>, while in the south-west (the
Taranaki country) there were frequent skirmishes between the troops and
hostile natives.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> To neither of these scenes of action were the Royal Irish
summoned; after occupying Ngaruawahia for three months the regiment
marched to Otahuhu camp, where it formed part of the garrison of Auckland
during the remainder of the year.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 1865, the Royal Irish were sent to the south-west
coast of the North island, to reinforce the small number of regular troops
holding the Taranaki (or New Plymouth) district, where since the war began
the British had been able to do little more than to hold redoubts round a few
settlements, and to send occasional punitive expeditions into the enemy’s
country. In the beginning of the campaign the rebel tribes, the adherents of
the King, had fought us solely on political grounds; they objected to our
presence and wished to drive us out of New Zealand, but no question of
religion entered into the quarrel. Many of the Maoris had embraced Christianity,
and had become such strict Sabbatarians that on one occasion the
garrison of a besieged <em>pah</em> left their works on a Sunday morning to attend
chapel, with results disastrous to themselves. But early in 1864, the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
learned that a set of fanatics had arisen, named Hau-Haus, whose tenets,
appealing to all that was worst in the Maori character, were a weird mixture
of cannibalism, paganism, and Christianity.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> In April 1864, a detachment of
the 57th was badly cut up near New Plymouth; an officer, Captain Lloyd,
and six men were killed by the Hau-Haus, who cut off their heads and drank
their blood. A few days later, according to the native accounts, the Angel
Gabriel appeared and ordered Lloyd’s head to be exhumed and carried
throughout New Zealand, to serve as the medium of Jehovah’s communication
with man. As soon as the head was disinterred it appointed priests, and
announced that thanks to the protection of Gabriel and his angels the
followers of the new religion would be invulnerable: the Virgin Mary would
be constantly present with them: the religion of England was false and its
scriptures must be burned; men and women were to live together promiscuously;
the priests would obtain victories by shouting the word “Hau,”<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>
and could invoke the help of legions of angels for the extermination of the
whites. As soon as New Zealand had rid itself of the English, men would
arrive from heaven to teach the Maoris all the arts and sciences known to
Europeans. This extraordinary creed is believed to have been evolved by
educated and unscrupulous natives, who realised that the Maoris had been
shaken in their allegiance to the “King movement” by the result of the
Waikato campaign, and that a stronger bond of union was required than a
purely political organisation, the fortunes of which were not then in the
ascendant.</p>

<p>Though in several affairs with the 57th the Hau-Haus learned by bitter
experience that they were by no means invulnerable to Enfield bullets, the
new religion found many converts. The tribes in the south-west of the North
island had always been turbulent and hostile. They had committed grave
and unprovoked outrages, such as the murder of a party of soldiers in 1863,
which heralded the outbreak of the war. They were now in a state of open
hostility, and almost the only part of the district which acknowledged the
Queen’s rule was the ground enclosed by the redoubts round the settlements
of Taranaki and Wanganui. The Government of New Zealand decided that
there could be no peace until the tribesmen had been chastised, their power
broken, and their country opened up. To accomplish these objects General
Cameron had about five thousand troops, a thousand white volunteers, and a
thousand native auxiliaries. His plan of campaign was that two columns,
one based on Taranaki, the other on Wanganui, should force their way along
the coast until they joined hands on the road between these two settlements.</p>

<p>On January 2, 1865, a detachment of seven companies (about 500 of all
ranks) of the Royal Irish, under Major J. H. Rocke, embarked for Wanganui<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
in H.M.S. <i>Falcon</i> and <i>Eclipse</i>, the remainder of the battalion being left
under Lieutenant-Colonel Chapman at Otahuhu camp. On the voyage the
<i>Eclipse</i> ran ashore on a sandbank, but the soldiers were transhipped to another
vessel, and on reaching their destination took their place in a column commanded
by Colonel Waddy, 50th, consisting of the Royal Irish; 50th; detachments
of Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers, and a small party of
extemporised cavalry, in all 963 officers and men. On January 24, Waddy
moved up the coast towards the Waitotara river. The route first led past
settlers’ farms, well-planted and rich in clover-fields, and then skirted native
villages, deserted by the Maoris, who had left their peach-groves and patches
of tobacco, Indian corn, and water-melons to the mercy of the troops. Next
came a weary stretch of steep sandhills, and it was late in the afternoon when
Waddy halted near a lake close to the Maori village of Nukumaru. During
the march no enemies had shown themselves, and from Colonel Waddy’s
report it appears that the camp was formed before the outposts were in
position. When the tents were pitched piquets were sent out; among them
was a party of the Royal Irish, under Captain Hugh Shaw, with orders to
take up ground half a mile to the north of the camp. Shaw moved off in
skirmishing order and cautiously approached a patch of bush close to the
village, which it was necessary to occupy. It was not until he was within
thirty yards of this bush that a large number of Maoris, lurking in the
thicket, disclosed their presence by a heavy fire. Though surprised, Shaw
kept his head, and remembering that he had just passed a small ditch with a
fence in front of it, rallied his party behind this meagre cover, which was
but sixty yards from the Maoris’ position. As soon as he had set his rifles to
work he counted his men, and found that one was missing, lying hard hit
half-way between the piquet and the natives in the bush. Shaw was in a
dilemma. To leave the man where he was would condemn him to certain
death, for at nightfall he would inevitably be tomahawked by the Maoris: to
order a few of the piquet to bring him in was to expose the rescue party to
very great danger, nor did Shaw wish to send men on a forlorn hope unless
he himself led them. Yet, if he did head a rescue party, he was technically
abandoning his post, and, during his absence, throwing upon his subordinates
the responsibility not only for the lives of the piquet but for the safety of
the whole camp. Shaw decided to face this risk&mdash;a very grave one, as the
events of the next day proved&mdash;and called for volunteers to help him save the
wounded man. Four private soldiers, Brandon, Brien, Kearnes, and Clampitt
sprang to their feet and dashed headlong after their officer. In a few
moments these five gallant men were bending over their comrade, whom they
found still living. The air around them seemed alive with bullets, for the
piquet was firing viciously at the puffs of smoke which marked the lairs of
the Maori sharpshooters, while the enemy concentrated his musketry upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
rescuers. There was no time to consult how best to move the wounded man:
Shaw caused him to be hoisted upon his own back, and, staggering under the
weight, carried him back in triumph to the piquet. Incredible as it may
seem, neither Shaw nor any of his companions were hit in this adventure.
Shaw was awarded the Victoria Cross, while privates James Kearnes, George
Clampitt, and John Brandon were presented with the silver medal for
distinguished conduct in the field.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>The sound of the firing brought up Major Rocke with a hundred men of
the battalion, and thanks to this reinforcement the piquet was able to
maintain so hot a fusilade that the enemy did not attempt either to surround,
or to close in upon them. For some hours the fire-fight raged, the natives
returning shot for shot; then the musketry died down, and the Maoris stole
away to the shelter of a neighbouring <em>pah</em>. Early on the morning of the
25th, the piquet was relieved by Captain Noblett with seventy-five of his
own men, and twenty-five of the 50th regiment. On the right he posted his
party of the XVIIIth near the village, while on the left his detachment of the
50th watched a deep watercourse, with banks covered by a thick growth of
wild flax. On the far side of this watercourse was another piquet, also of the
50th, but not under Noblett’s command. During the forenoon not an enemy
was seen; the bush seemed absolutely deserted, but it was the lull before the
storm. In the middle of the day the Maoris suddenly abandoned their
traditional policy of standing on the defensive in carefully fortified positions,
and two columns, in all about 600 men, falling simultaneously on the flanks
of Noblett’s piquet swept it before them, and pushed forward so vigorously
through the breach thus made in the outpost line that for a time the safety of
the camp was seriously imperilled. From the scanty details preserved of this
interesting fight it appears that about two <span class="fs70">P.M.</span> Captain Noblett heard firing
on his left, where Enfield bullets were falling among his detachment of the
50th. On hurrying to the point of danger, he discovered that these badly
directed bullets came from the far side of the watercourse, where the distant
piquet of the 50th was trying to stem a Maori rush. After making necessary
dispositions he ran back to the right of his ground, to find that there also the
natives were attacking in strength; they had set fire to the bush, and under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
cover of the smoke were pushing fast through the village, and driving the
piquet of the XVIIIth backwards towards the camp. When the alarm was
given all the troops not on outpost fell in and hurried up to the front. The
first party ready to move was Captain Daubeny’s company of the XVIIIth; in
a short time they met Captain Noblett’s piquet in full retreat; Noblett rallied
his men upon the reinforcement, and then the two detachments, extending
into skirmishing order, by their steady front and well-sustained fire effectively
checked the enemy. Elsewhere, however, things did not go so well, and the
natives were almost in the camp before the combined effect of a charge of
mounted men and the shells of 6-pr. Armstrong guns drove them back into
the bush. In their retreat the Maoris abandoned twenty-two killed and two
wounded, and succeeded in carrying away about seventy dead or injured
warriors. In the two days’ fighting the British casualties were&mdash;officers, one
killed and two wounded; other ranks, fifteen killed and thirty wounded. The
losses of the XVIIIth were three private soldiers killed and twelve wounded,
one mortally.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> The General in his report favourably mentioned the names of
Major Rocke, Captain Shaw, and Captain Dawson.</p>

<p>After this repulse the Maoris retired to a <em>pah</em> close by at Wereroa, a
position which they deemed impregnable. This opinion General Cameron
appeared to share, for he did not attack, but, hoping to entice the enemy out
of his works, moved slowly up the coast. At the mouth of the Waitotara
river Major Rocke and four companies of the Royal Irish were left to guard a
bridge of casks, while the remainder of the battalion, recently joined by the
three headquarter companies under Lieutenant-Colonel Chapman, marched
with the rest of the column to Patea. Here they remained for many months
in charge of a line of posts on the road between Wanganui and Taranaki,
sharing in only one of the few operations which took place in this part of the
country in 1865.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>The state of affairs in New Zealand at this time was very unfortunate.
General Cameron, who commanded the Queen’s troops, was at daggers drawn
with Sir George Grey, the Governor of the colony. The New Zealand
ministry was wrangling fiercely with the Cabinet at home, for at the very
time that Cameron announced he could not carry out Grey’s policy without
considerable reinforcements of regular troops, the Colonial Office intimated
that the War Office was about to withdraw five battalions from New Zealand.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>
The General was already worn out by physical fatigue and mental anxiety:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
the threatened withdrawal of the troops was the last straw on the camel’s
back; on the ground of ill-health Cameron asked to be relieved of his
command, and in August, 1865, was succeeded by Major-General Trevor Chute.
About a month before the new Commander-in-Chief arrived, Sir George Grey,
who had in vain urged Cameron to attack the <em>pah</em> at Wereroa, remembered
that before entering the service of the Colonial Office he had been a captain in
the army, and determined to prove to the Maoris that their vaunted stronghold
was not impregnable. On the morning of July 20, he assembled a small
column, consisting of a hundred of the 14th regiment, an equal number of the
Royal Irish under Captain Noblett, and about four hundred and seventy
colonists and friendly natives. In his plan of attack Grey allotted a duty to
the regular troops which required great discipline and steadiness: they were
to demonstrate, and threaten an attack upon the front, the best defended face
of the fortification, while the colonists and “friendlies,” by a long and circuitous
march, established themselves on ground from which the rear of the Maori
works could be commanded. The two hundred regular troops pitched their
tents well within view of the natives, threw out posts, marched and counter-marched,
and successfully “bluffed” the enemy into the belief that a large
body of soldiers were preparing for an assault. The irregulars succeeded in
placing themselves unseen in rear of the <em>pah</em>; there was some work with the
rifle, and then the Maoris, seized with panic, swarmed down a steep cliff and
abandoned their fortress, almost without firing a shot in its defence. A
reinforcement of fifty of the XVIIIth were brought up from the line of
communication by Major Rocke, who was now in command of the regiment,<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>
but they took no part in the affair. The enemy lost fifty men and many
stores: in Sir George Grey’s column there appear to have been no casualties.</p>

<p>For the rest of the year 1865 the headquarters of the battalion remained
at Patea, with detachments along the coast. In December, General Chute was
directed by the Governor to prepare an expedition against the Hau-Haus who
infested the country between Taranaki and Wanganui. He drew a hundred
officers and men under Major Rocke from the posts held by the Royal Irish;
139 of all ranks from the 14th regiment; about 100 from the 50th, and with
45 of the Forest Rangers and 300 native auxiliaries, took the field at the
beginning of January, 1866. After making himself master of the strongly
palisaded village of Otahuhu,<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> he led his column on a more difficult enterprise,
the capture of the Putahi <em>pah</em>, which stood in a clearing on the top of a hill,
500 feet in height, with sides rough with spurs, seamed in every direction by
watercourses, and covered with dense jungle. Only one path led from the
plain to the summit through this labyrinth, difficult in itself and rendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
almost impassable by the stockades and other defences with which it was
known to bristle. Chute decided to avoid this death-trap by attacking the
<em>pah</em> from the rear. Long before dawn on the 7th of January, 1866, his troops
had begun a march, which in his despatch he described as “one continued
struggle through a dense primeval forest and bush, over ravines and gullies
which could in most cases only be ascended and descended by the aid of
supple jack, and then only with great difficulty. The distance to be traversed
could not have exceeded four miles, but the obstacles and obstructions opposed
to us made it a severe task for four hours.” General Chute’s method of
attacking the Maori works was rough but effective. “There was usually,”
writes General Alexander, “an open plateau in front of the <em>pahs</em>; he brought
his men there to the edge of the bush, and when his line and supports and
natives in reserve were all ready he made his bugler sound a single G; the
men advanced from under cover, and on the double G being given a rush was
made at the <em>pah</em>, hatchets were drawn from the belts of the men, the withes
of the outer fence were suddenly cut, the palisading broken through, and the
<em>pah</em> stormed with cheering in the smoke.” Such was his plan at the capture
of Putahi. As soon as the Forest Rangers reached the plateau they opened
out into skirmishing order, lying down within 400 yards of the enemy to
cover the formation of the remainder of the troops, who as they emerged
gradually from the bush were extended&mdash;the detachment of the XVIIIth on
the right, the 14th in the centre, and the 50th on the left, with the native
contingent in reserve. It was more than an hour before the soldiers at the
rear of the column, breathless from their exertions in scaling precipices, had
found their places in the ranks. During that time the Hau-Hau garrison,
about two hundred strong, had first performed a war dance to keep up their
spirits, and then fired, but with little effect, upon the troops. When Chute’s
line was in order he gave the word to advance. Under a heavy but almost
harmless fusilade the soldiers moved forward, as steadily as on an ordinary
parade; when they were within eighty yards of the enemy the double G was
sounded; they charged and burst into the <em>pah</em>, driving the enemy before them
headlong into the bush. A general pursuit followed, in which the Hau-Haus
are said to have lost considerably; then the troops were called off; the <em>pah</em>
was destroyed and the column marched back to camp. In this affair the
British casualties were two men killed and ten wounded, none of them
belonging to the XVIIIth.</p>

<p>In the course of the next few days General Chute captured several more
of the Hau-Hau strongholds, and wound up his punitive expedition by
marching round the east of Mount Egmont to Taranaki, by a track believed
to be impracticable for civilised troops. In these successes, however, the
XVIIIth had no share, for Rocke’s party was ordered back to Patea the day
after the Putahi <em>pah</em> was captured. With Chute’s march the war, as far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
most of the regular army was concerned, came to an end. The British
Government decided that the Imperial forces should no longer be actively
employed, as it considered that the Maoris had been sufficiently weakened for
the colonists to finish the struggle without further help from the mother
country.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> Nearly all the troops were accordingly withdrawn from the neighbourhood
of Wanganui; the Royal Irish, however, remained in their old posts
in the Patea-Wanganui district, which continued to be much harassed by
rebellious tribes. Communication along the coast road was interrupted;
small parties of colonists were frequently surprised and murdered; and the
local forces were twice rudely handled in operations in the bush. Occasionally
the garrisons of the posts made sorties against the insurgents, but nothing of
importance occurred until October, 1866, when the Governor arrived at Patea
and called upon Major Rocke for the help of his regiment in quelling disturbances
in the country round Wanganui. Major Rocke was in the happy
position of being his own commanding-officer, with no senior present to whom
the question had to be referred. He joyfully responded to Sir George Grey’s
appeal by organising a mobile column of three hundred Royal Irish and an
equal number of New Zealand militia, and led the combined force to Waingongoro,
where the Governor at an interview with the rebel leaders failed to
persuade them to lay down their arms. Sir George Grey at once moved
towards Papoia, a native village buried in the heart of the forest, believed to
be strongly fortified, and known to be approachable only by difficult paths.
He determined to surprise this village by an attack at dawn, and Rocke accordingly
paraded his men at midnight on the 17th-18th of October. The Royal
Irish led the march, preceded by a storming party under Lieutenant Pringle, who
had volunteered for this dangerous duty. Silently, and with every precaution
to avoid giving the alarm to their watchful enemy, the Royal Irish slowly
followed the friendly natives who guided them along a steep and narrow
track. At daybreak the men at the head of the column noticed that the path
was leading into a glen, and a few minutes later discovered that across this
glen the Hau-Haus had thrown a huge barricade, nine feet in height, made of
the trunks of trees and crowned with a stiff “post and rails” fence. At this
moment a number of natives, hidden in the bush, opened a heavy fire upon the
storming party, but Pringle disregarded this flank attack, and with his men
rushed at the barricade, breached it with axes, and drove the defenders into
the bush. The rest of the column poured through the gap and swarmed into
the village, which the Maoris hastily abandoned, leaving several dead behind
them. This success, obtained without loss to the XVIIIth, was quickly
followed up by Rocke, who, making his way across country hitherto believed
to be impassable to Europeans, raided several hostile villages, which the Hau-Haus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
cowed by the capture of Papoia, abandoned without resistance. At the
conclusion of this three weeks’ campaign, the gallantry of Lieutenant Pringle
in his charge on the barricade was brought to the notice of the officer commanding
the troops in New Zealand; and two of the men who accompanied
him, privates Acton and Hennigan, were awarded the medal for distinguished
conduct in the field.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> It may here be mentioned that although this affair was
the last in which regular soldiers took part, it was not until 1869 that the
issue of a medal for the New Zealand war was sanctioned, while not until
1870 was leave given to the regiments which had been engaged in the war to
add the words “New Zealand” to the battle honours on their Colours. For
their services Brevet-Colonel G. J. Carey and Brevet-Lieutenant-Colonel Sir
H. M. Havelock, Bart., V.C., were created Companions of the Order of the
Bath; Major J. H. Rocke received a Brevet-Lieutenant-Colonelcy; and Captains
J. Inman and T. D. Baker were promoted to Brevet-Majorities.</p>

the Maoris their casualties were&mdash;</p>

<p>Until March 1867, the regiment continued to hold the line of posts between
Patea and Wanganui; then the condition of the country warranted the concentration
of the Royal Irish at the latter place, where they remained till
December, when headquarters and six companies were sent to Auckland, with
two detachments, each of two companies, at Napier and Taranaki. When the
headquarter companies reached Auckland the command of the battalion was
assumed by Lieutenant-Colonel G. A. Elliot, who had arrived from England
on promotion from the first battalion, <em>vice</em> Colonel Chapman, retired on half-pay.
At this time the effective strength of the battalion was 861, all told.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p>There is little of interest to chronicle in the doings of the battalion during
the year 1868. The headquarters remained at Auckland, with detachments
in various parts of the colony. The armament of the Royal Irish was
modernised by the issue of Snider breech-loading rifles to replace the muzzle-loading
Enfields with which the men had hitherto been provided. In December<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
Colonel Beatson, the officer who for a year and a half had commanded the
troops in New Zealand, left the colony; before sailing he issued farewell
orders in which he expressed his “unqualified satisfaction with the correct
and soldierly conduct of the 2nd battalion, XVIIIth Royal Irish regiment,
which reflects credit not only on themselves alone but also on the British
army of which they are now almost the only representatives in this distant
colony.” Early in 1869, the battalion was warned to be in readiness to relieve
the 50th in Australia. The European population, however, strongly opposed
the departure of the Royal Irish: officers and men were alike popular with
all classes of society, and while on personal grounds the colonists wished to
retain the regiment among them, from the political point of view they
deprecated the withdrawal of the XVIIIth, who were the rear-guard of the
British army in New Zealand. As a concession the Ministry at home reluctantly
postponed the departure of the battalion, but after a few months
again ordered it to Australia. The Government of New Zealand remonstrated
warmly against this decision, and offered to guarantee for five years any
annual payment which the War Office might fix as the price of the retention
of the XVIIIth. But as the Imperial Government had decided to throw upon
the settlers the responsibility for the defence of the colony, it decided that
no regular troops should remain in New Zealand, and at the beginning of
1870 the battalion embarked, the headquarters and four companies for
Sydney, and detachments of two companies each for Melbourne, Adelaide,
and Hobart.</p>

<p>How highly the Royal Irish were appreciated in New Zealand will be
seen by the following extracts from official documents, newspaper articles, and
farewell speeches on the subject of their departure. Sir George Bowen, who
succeeded Sir George Grey as Governor of the colony, recorded his “sense of
the important service rendered by the 2nd battalion, XVIIIth Royal Irish
during the present rebellion, and also of the admirable conduct of the officers
and men, who have invariably maintained the most cordial relations with
their fellow-subjects. Their approaching departure is viewed with deep and
general regret both on public and on personal grounds.”<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>In a speech made by Sir George Arney, Chief Justice of the Colony, on the
16th of February 1870, the following passage occurs:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I believe that every inhabitant of New Zealand has heard often of
the 18th Royal Irish&mdash;has heard not only of that gallant and distinguished
regiment, but also of the society of gentlemen who have
won the affections, I believe, and certainly have commanded the respect,
of the whole colony. And that which I have said of the Officers, I may
in some degree also say of the men. As the head of one special department,
I can say that during my long sojourn here, I have known no other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
regiment which has been so distinguished by its freedom from crime; and
the men of this regiment have themselves thus become respected, not only
by those of their immediate class, but by all classes of society in the
Colony. That circumstance must be taken as due not only to the efficient
command of the Officer at the head of the regiment, but also to the
temper and discretion with which his orders have been carried out by the
Officers of the regiment. I will say but little on the fact that this
Colony is now losing the presence of this gallant regiment; it is a
subject which, I believe, is a painful one to the hearts of the whole of
the colonists in New Zealand. I believe that the 18th will be universally
regretted, as they are now universally respected.”</p></div>

<p>The Ministers of the New Zealand government also gave their testimony
to the good conduct of the regiment in a communication to the Governor.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">Memorandum for His Excellency.</span></p>

<p>“Ministers cannot permit the last detachment of Her Majesty’s 18th
regiment to leave the Colony without expressing the regret which they
feel at the departure of the regiment, and bearing testimony of the
uniform good conduct of the force under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel
Elliot, during the period of its service in the Colony; the sentiment
which the Government thus places on record is that of the whole
community.</p>

<p>“The Government also desires to express the feeling which it entertains
of the readiness which Lieutenant-Colonel Elliot, and the Officers
commanding detachments under him, have always displayed to aid the
Colony as far as lay in their power.</p>

<p>“The Government also desires to record its appreciation of the
uniform courtesy and consideration which they have experienced on the
part of Lieutenant-Colonel Elliot in their communications with him
through His Excellency the Governor.</p>

<p class="right">
“(Signed) <span class="smcap">William Fox</span>,<br />
<span class="fs90 padr2">“<em>Premier</em>.”</span></p></div>

<p>By the beginning of March, 1870, the various detachments of the regiment
had settled down in their new stations, but they were not destined long to
enjoy the pleasures of life in the capitals of the Australian colonies,<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> for very
soon came orders for the regiment to return to England. The policy of
withdrawing all Imperial troops from New Zealand had been carried out.
It was now Australia’s turn to be denuded of her garrison, and in August
1870, after hundreds of men had taken their discharges in order to settle in
Australasia, the Royal Irish embarked for Plymouth. The sailing ship <i>Silver
Eagle</i> left Sydney on the 21st of August with the four headquarter companies;
Lieutenant-Colonel Elliot was in command, and with him were one captain, four
subalterns, two surgeons, and one hundred and thirty-five other ranks. On
board the sailing ship <i>Corona</i>, which left Melbourne about the same time, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Brevet-Lieutenant-Colonel Rocke and two other field-officers, five captains, nine
subalterns, and two hundred and forty-six other ranks. The <i>Corona</i> arrived
at Plymouth on November 16; the <i>Silver Eagle</i> made so long a voyage
round Cape Horn that before she reached port on December 5th, it was
currently reported that she had been lost at sea.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Australians were profoundly moved when the Royal Irish left their
shores. The XVIIIth was already very popular, and apart from this personal
feeling, the settlers were deeply wounded at the removal of this, the
last British regiment of the garrison of Australasia. While all men regarded
this step as the breaking of one of the few visible links between the mother
country and her offshoots in the southern hemisphere, many pessimists hinted
that the policy of the Home government was intended to force all the colonies
into a declaration of independence. When the <i>Corona</i> sailed from Melbourne
fifty thousand people crowded to the beach to wave a sad farewell to
the XVIIIth, gloomily comparing the departure of the regiment with the
abandonment of Britain by the Roman legions. Happily these prophets
of evil were mistaken. The loyalty of the colonies to the Empire is unimpaired,
and the tie of sentiment has been strengthened by the presence in
three African campaigns of large bodies of volunteers from Canada, Australia,
and New Zealand, who fought shoulder to shoulder with Imperial troops
in quarrels with which the colonists were concerned solely as members of the
British race. Though the offer of two thousand Australasian militia and
volunteers to serve against the Boers in the war of 1881 was refused by
Mr Gladstone’s government, four years later eight hundred men from New
South Wales were fighting at Suakim, and four hundred Canadian <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voyageurs</i>
were steering whale-boats upon the Nile in the expedition towards Khartoum:
while in the recent struggle with the Boers for the possession of South Africa,
nearly thirty thousand men from Greater Britain represented the oversea
provinces of the Empire in the army of the old country.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When the second battalion landed in England, it was quartered at Devonport,
where the energies of the officers and non-commissioned officers were
devoted to welding into shape the recruits enlisted to fill its depleted ranks.
These youths were of poor physique and small stature, and only three
hundred were finally accepted as suitable for the Service, but good food and
systematic training did wonders for them: in a year their average height had
increased an inch, while they had grown two inches wider round the chest.
The burden of drilling and disciplining this mass of raw material fell
upon the adjutant, Lieutenant H. B. Moore; his success was so conspicuous
that when he left the army in 1873, Lieutenant-Colonel S. Wilson, who in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
1871 had succeeded Colonel Elliot in command, warmly thanked him for his
work in a regimental order. During the six years spent by the battalion
at various garrison towns in England nothing of interest occurred, except that
the Royal Irish were represented in the Ashantee war by Major T. D. Baker
and Lieutenant I. W. Graves, both of whom were mentioned in despatches.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
In June, 1876, the retirement of Colonel Wilson placed Lieutenant-Colonel
R. H. Daniel in command; and in the following month began a tour of duty
in Ireland, as barren of events as had been that in England. The battalion
was at Kilkenny in the spring of 1878, when in anticipation of a possible war
with Russia part of the reserve was called out, and four hundred men from
the Kilkenny and Wexford militia were poured into the ranks of the Royal
Irish, whose officers led a strenuous life during the three months of the
embodiment. On the death of Colonel Daniel in May, 1882, Lieutenant-Colonel
C. F. Gregorie arranged an exchange with Lieutenant-Colonel M. J. R.
M‘Gregor, first battalion, and was gazetted to the command of the second
battalion on September 14, 1878. After passing three years in Ireland, the
home battalion of the Royal Irish spent two years at Aldershot, and then was
moved to Chatham where the marching-in state showed a strength of 15
officers, 37 sergeants, 12 drummers and 356 rank and file. Here it remained
until August, 1882, when it embarked for Egypt on active service.</p>

<span class="fs55">CHANGES IN ARMY ORGANISATION: THE SECOND AFGHAN WAR.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">While the second battalion of the Royal Irish regiment was winning its spurs
in New Zealand, the first was quartered in southern India. At the end of
1865 it was ordered home; volunteering into other corps was permitted, and
381 non-commissioned officers and men elected to finish their service in the
East, while 29 officers<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> and 450 other ranks, with 44 women and 72 children,
embarked in February, 1866, at Bombay in two ships, the slower of which did
not reach England until the end of June. Two years later the battalion was
sent to Ireland, and in August, 1871, was warned for another tour of foreign
service. This order filled all ranks with dismay, for if any corps in the
British army had the right to expect a long rest at home it was the
first battalion of the XVIIIth. Since 1692, when it first landed on the
Continent, it had spent a hundred and nineteen years out of the United
Kingdom, and between 1837, when it sailed for Ceylon, and its return from
India in 1866, it had served abroad with one short break of less than six
months’ duration; it had fought with distinction in China, in Burma, and
in the Crimea, and had shared in the suppression of the Indian Mutiny. To
explain why the War Office sent the first battalion on foreign service again
so quickly, it becomes necessary to allude briefly to the long series of changes
in the organisation of the army which began to take effect in 1870.</p>

<p>The strain thrown on the military resources of Britain by the Crimean
War and the Indian Mutiny had convinced even the most determined
economists in the House of Commons not only that the army was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
too small, but that it was utterly lacking in power of rapid expansion
in case of need. To increase its numbers in time of peace was comparatively
easy, and by the addition in 1858-59 of second battalions to the
twenty-five senior regiments of the line, the infantry was materially
strengthened. But to render the army more elastic, more fit to meet a
sudden national emergency, was a far more difficult matter. The process
by which the XVIIIth was brought up to war strength for the Crimea<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
was the only method then known for making a regiment ready to take the
field, for as there were no reservists to replace men too weakly or too young
for a campaign, the ranks of a corps ordered on active service could only
be filled by the depletion of other units, which by this process of “robbing
Peter to pay Paul” were reduced to impotence, until they in turn had
obtained recruits and trained the raw material into soldiers. Of the various
attempts to form an adequate reserve one only was successful&mdash;the
“militia reserve,” composed of the best men in the constitutional force, who
for a small annual retaining fee undertook in case of need to serve as
regular soldiers in any part of the world. But this was only a reversion
to the methods of the Crimean days, for it called away the pick of
the militia at the moment when they were required, if not for active
service, at least for garrison duty at home and in the Mediterranean; and
at best it could produce but a limited supply of men who were obviously
very inferior in quality to well-trained ex-regular soldiers. The problem of
how to create an adequate reserve remained virtually unsolved for many
years, though numberless committees were appointed to consider the question
in all its bearings. The subject was, indeed, most complex. The army at
home had to be prepared to defend the British Isles, to embark on expeditions
beyond the limits of the United Kingdom, and to replace the waste
caused by death, by invaliding, and by the discharge of “time-expired”
men among the troops abroad, of whom 70,000 were quartered in India, while
nearly 50,000 more were scattered in garrisons among our fortresses and
colonies in other parts of the world. Gradually the opinion gained ground
that it was hopeless to expect the army to discharge these varied duties,
unless there was behind it a large body of highly-trained and disciplined
men who, when a war was imminent, could be counted upon to reinforce
the troops at home; and the brilliant success of the Prussians in “the
Seven Weeks’ War” of 1866, determined our government to adopt a
modification of the German principle of short service with the Colours,
followed by a period of service in the Reserve. To devise a system suitable
to an army recruited by voluntary enlistment, and of which a very large
proportion is normally stationed abroad, required years of preparation, and
it was not until 1870 that Mr Cardwell, then Secretary of State for War,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
began to introduce the great innovations which modernised the British army.
By the abolition of “purchase,” rich men were no longer able to buy their
steps, and by the power of the purse obtain promotion over the heads of
their poorer comrades; the ages were fixed at which officers of various ranks
were to retire, so that a reasonable flow of promotion was obtained; the
garrisons of the tropical colonies were reduced, while those of the great
oversea provinces were gradually withdrawn; recruits were enlisted for
twelve years&mdash;the first six to be passed with the Colours, and the remainder
in the Reserve; while to provide for an adequate and systematic flow of
trained men to India and our other outlying possessions, regiments were
linked together in pairs&mdash;one serving at home, the other abroad. One of
the functions of the “home” battalion was to impart to the recruits the
ground-work of military training, and, when the young soldiers were fit
to serve out of the United Kingdom, to send them in drafts to the “foreign”
battalion, where they remained for the rest of their service with the
Colours, and then on their return to the United Kingdom were transferred
to the Reserve. In the first twenty-five regiments, which already possessed
two battalions, the process of “linking” was effected without the difficulty
and friction which frequently occurred in cases where two corps, strangers
to each other in tradition and sentiment, were suddenly brought into the
intimate relation of virtual partnership; and when in 1882, regiments
ceased to be designated by numbers, and the identity of the original units
was merged into that of the territorial regiment, the XVIIIth became the
Royal Irish regiment with no regret beyond that of the loss of the number
under which it had won distinctions in every part of the world.</p>

<p>As the second battalion had only just returned from New Zealand and
Australia, it was the turn of the first battalion, under the newly introduced
system, to go abroad; and on January 18, 1872, Lieutenant-Colonel G. H.
Pocklington, with 26 officers and 606 other ranks, embarked for Malta.
After three years the first battalion, 917 strong, sailed for India under
command of Lieutenant-Colonel E. L. Dillon, and early in December reached
Bareilly, where it was quartered for nearly four years. While it was at this
station His Majesty King Edward VII., then Prince of Wales, made a Royal
progress through the Eastern Empire that would one day be his, and on
the 6th of March, 1876, stopped at Bareilly on his way from the Terai to
Allahabad: His Royal Highness was received by a guard of honour of the
Royal Irish, while the remainder of the battalion lined the avenue through
which he passed on his way to the palace of the Nawab of Rampore. In the
evening the Prince did the battalion the honour of dining with the officers,
and gave to the mess portraits of the Princess of Wales and himself as
a memento of his visit, and a few days later two large steel engravings
of the Prince and Princess of Wales were sent by His Royal Highness as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
a present to the sergeants’ mess. A year later the death occurred of Field-Marshal
Sir John Forster Fitzgerald, G.C.B.,<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> who since 1850, when he
succeeded Lord Aylmer, had been the Colonel of the XVIIIth, Royal Irish
regiment. This veteran, whose age had earned for him the title of “the
father of the British Army,” was born in Ireland in 1786, before the abolition
of the iniquitous system by which wealthy men were allowed to buy commissions
for infants prattling in the nursery. At the mature age of eight
Fitzgerald was a captain in the regular army, at seventeen he was a major,
and he obtained his lieutenant-colonelcy when only twenty-four years of
age. He served in the Peninsula, commanding a brigade in the battle of the
Pyrenees in 1813; in 1854 he became General, and in 1875 received a Field-Marshal’s
bâton. He died in March, 1877, at Tours, and by the special order
of Marshal Macmahon, then President of the French Republic, the whole
of the garrison attended the funeral to pay to the British officer the honours
accorded to Frenchmen of his exalted military rank. He was succeeded as
Colonel of the XVIIIth by Lieutenant-General Clement A. Edwards, C.B.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>The first battalion changed stations from Bareilly to Ferozepore in
February, 1878, and just after Lieutenant-Colonel M. MacGregor succeeded
to the command on September 13, 1878, two companies were detached to
Mooltan, while a third was sent to Dera Ismail Khan, one of the posts
guarding the north-west frontier of India. For a few days there seemed
to be a chance of “blooding” some of the young soldiers of the XVIIIth, for
the Mahsood Waziris raided into our country and burned the town of Tank
some thirty miles from Dera Ismail Khan. The native cavalry of the
garrison were at once sent to the scene of the outrage, and fell heavily
upon the freebooters, many of whom were killed and wounded, while the
remainder fled to the neighbouring hills, where they threw up sangars and
challenged us to attack them. But the officer in command of the British
column was not disposed to squander the lives of his troops by assaulting
stone breast-works without a preliminary bombardment; and remembering
that some of the Royal Irish had been taught gun-drill at Dera Ismail Khan,
he ordered up a couple of pieces, manned by soldiers of the XVIIIth under
an officer of the regiment, Lieutenant H. Shuldham-Lye. The amateur gunners,
“spoiling for a fight,” pushed on to Tank at speed, but when the
tribesmen heard that guns were to be used against them they suddenly
dispersed, and the little campaign came to an end. For its services the
detachment was officially thanked by the officer in command of the
operations.</p>

<p>A few months after the Royal Irish arrived at Ferozepore Russian
intrigues involved Britain in war with Afghanistan, an independent State
whose mountains overhang part of the north-west frontier of India. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
early as 1837, England and Russia were contending for the privilege of
directing the foreign policy of the Amir of Afghanistan, upon whose borders
the rival European Powers were advancing by giant strides in the course
of their Asiatic conquests; and when the Amir, Dost Mahomed, cordially
welcomed a Russian officer, who brought from the Czar proposals for an
alliance against England, our government determined to depose Dost
Mahomed and to replace him with a nominee of their own. The attempt
to carry this scheme into execution produced the first Afghan war, in
which the Czar made no effort to help the Amir, being satisfied at having
involved his great rival in an expensive and disastrous campaign with the
country he proposed some day to use as a stepping-stone in the invasion
of India. At the end of the Crimean war Russia, foiled in her projects
against Turkey, devoted her energies to the subjugation of Central Asia,
where vast territories fell into her hands; and by the conquest of Khiva
in 1873, she advanced her outposts to within four hundred miles of our
Indian frontier, establishing herself within easy striking distance of
Afghanistan. Shere Ali, the Amir, trembling for his independence, offered
his friendship to England if she would give him a specific promise of help
against Muscovite aggression, but as our government refused any such
guarantee he decided to throw in his lot with Russia. In 1877, there was
war between the Sultan and the Czar, and as it seemed probable that
England would again intervene by force of arms to save Turkey from
annihilation, the Russians intrigued more vigorously than ever with
Afghanistan, sending a military envoy to the Amir, who received him with
every mark of distinction. To counteract the effect produced in every
village in India by the knowledge that a Russian envoy had been officially
welcomed at Kabul, the Viceroy decided that a British mission should visit
Shere Ali, who was informed that Sir Neville Chamberlain was coming to
discuss matters of importance with him in a friendly spirit. In due time
the mission set forth from Peshawar, but in the Khyber Pass, just within
the Amir’s boundary, its members were turned back by Afghan troops, who
under orders from Kabul refused to allow them to advance farther into
Afghanistan. As Shere Ali declined to apologise for this insult, war became
inevitable, and after our ultimatum had been rejected British troops invaded
his country from various points.</p>

<p>It is not proposed to describe the operations of the second Afghan war,
for the first battalion of the Royal Irish, upon whom fortune had frowned
during the Mutiny, were still pursued by ill luck, and played but the
smallest part in the campaign. Though the war began in November 1878,
it was not until the beginning of the following year that the first battalion
was ordered up from Ferozepore to join the reserve division of the Northern
Afghanistan field force at Peshawar. A few weeks later this division was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
broken up; the battalion was transferred to the Khyber Line force; and on
May 2, 1879, eight hundred and four stalwart Royal Irishmen found themselves
at the foot of the great wall of rock which forbids access to Afghanistan
from the plains of India.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> This natural rampart is pierced by the Khyber
Pass&mdash;a dark and gloomy gorge, winding its way between high mountains
which so nearly approach each other that in places their rugged sides
are only ten or twelve feet apart. Through this defile, one of the most
difficult in the world, runs the track which for centuries has been the
highway of commerce between Central Asia and Hindustan. In the middle
of the pass the mountains, suddenly receding, form a plain, where the battalion
spent the next ten months in discharging the useful but unattractive duties
which fall to the lot of line of communication troops. They had to hold
Lundi Kotal and Ali Musjid; to provide escorts for convoys through the
pass, and to piquet the neighbouring hills. The guards were numerous,
for the local tribesmen were expert thieves, to whom every British rifle
was worth its weight in rupees; and notwithstanding the vigilance of the
sentries in the sangars round the camp, Afridi robbers succeeded in abstracting
a few firearms from the tents in which the men were sleeping. A good many
non-commissioned officers and privates were lucky enough to escape from
the drudgery of this existence by obtaining employment as signallers on
the Kabul-Peshawar line, where from constant practice they became experts
with flag and heliograph. During the summer there was a sharp outbreak
of cholera in the battalion, which cost the lives of Quartermaster R. Barrett
and sixty of the other ranks.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> “It came up from India in the most curious
way, right along the signallers’ posts. We heard of it first at Jumrood; a
few days afterwards a man in the first post was taken ill; a few days
more and the second post was attacked, though there appeared to be no
communication possible (except by heliograph) between the posts, and it
gradually kept on till it reached the regiment. We knew it was coming;
we could not move, and I think,” writes an officer, “that it showed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
staunchness of the Royal Irish that they never went to pieces at all.” To
keep up the spirits of the men and give them some amusement the officers
rigged up a gymnasium and laid out a polo-ground and racecourse, where
regimental gymkhanas were often held.</p>

<p>Although the first battalion was not actively engaged in the Afghan
war, the officers and men who served in the Khyber Pass received the
medal, and the regiment was permitted to add the words “Afghanistan
1879-80” to its battle honours. At the end of the campaign in 1881 the
Royal Irish returned to India, and for the next two years and a half oscillated
between the great cantonment of Rawal Pindi and the hill station of
Kuldurrah. On May 23, 1882, when Lieutenant-Colonel M. MacGregor’s
term of command expired, he was succeeded by Lieutenant-Colonel H. Shaw,
V.C., and in July of the same year the death of Lieutenant-General Edwards
broke one of the few links still connecting the XVIIIth with its campaigns
in the middle of the nineteenth century. He died full of years and honours,
respected and admired not only by the regiment with which he had passed
the best years of his life, but by every officer and man with whom he had
served during his long career.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> Lieutenant-General and Honorary General

A few weeks after the Royal Irish lost their Colonel, the second battalion
sailed from England for Egypt to take part in the campaign described in
the next chapter. The first battalion continued to serve in India until
August, 1884, when in its turn it was summoned to Egypt as one of the
corps selected for the attempt to rescue General Gordon from the dangers
besetting him at Khartoum. The account of the doings of the first battalion
in the Nile Expedition will be found in <a href="#CHAPTER_XII">chapter xii</a>.</p>

<span class="fs55">THE WAR IN EGYPT.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">In <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter iv</a>. the campaign of 1801 is described, in which the Royal Irish
regiment played a distinguished part in the expulsion of the French from
Egypt. To explain why, more than eighty years later, it became necessary
for British troops again to take the field in the valley of the Nile, a few
words of historical retrospect are necessary. Our short occupation of Egypt
in 1801 was purely military and in no way interfered with the status of
the country, which for many years continued nominally to be a province
of the Ottoman Empire. In the first half of the nineteenth century an
adventurer named Mahomed Ali, who started in life as a small government
official in Turkish employ, made himself master of Egypt and conquered
the Soudan, a vast no-man’s land, which from Wadi-Halfa, the southern
boundary of Egypt proper, stretched for 1300 miles up the valley of the
Nile. For thirty years he waged an intermittent war with the Sublime
Porte, occupying Syria and threatening the safety of the Sultan in Constantinople
itself, until the great Powers of Europe, which in 1827 had combined
to destroy the Turkish fleet at Navarino, united in 1840 to save
the Ottoman Empire from disruption, and sent a joint naval expedition
against Mahomed’s garrisons on the Syrian seaboard. Next year the Sultan
made peace with his rebellious vassal, who restored Syria to his overlord
as the price of the hereditary viceroyalty of Egypt, which was then conferred
upon him. A few years later the opening of the “overland route,”
by which mails and passengers for the East were carried between Alexandria
and Suez, began to bring Egypt closely within the sphere of British
politics; and the completion in 1869 of the Suez canal by a French company,
whose moving spirit was M. de Lesseps, the engineer, made the
safety of the new waterway, and the good government of the country
through which it ran a matter of paramount importance to the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
Empire.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> Yet England by no means desired to add the possession of Egypt to
her other burdens. Her attitude is well described by Lord Cromer:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The general political interest of England was clear. England did
not want to possess Egypt, but it was essential to British interests that
the country should not fall into the hands of any other European Power.
British policy, in respect to Egypt, had for years past been based on this
principle. In 1857 the Emperor Napoleon III. made overtures to the
British Government with a view to the partition of the northern portions
of Africa. Morocco was to fall to France, Tunis to Sardinia, and Egypt
to England. On this proposal being submitted to Lord Palmerston, he
stated his views in a letter to Lord Clarendon. ‘It is very possible,’ he
said, ‘that many parts of the world would be better governed by France,
England, and Sardinia than they now are.... We do not want to have
Egypt. What we wish about Egypt is that it should continue to be
attached to the Turkish Empire, which is a security against its belonging
to any European Power. We want to trade with Egypt and to travel
through Egypt, but we do not want the burden of governing Egypt.... Let
us try and improve all these countries by the general influence of
our commerce, but let us abstain from a crusade of conquest which would
call down upon us the condemnation of all other civilised nations.’ On
another occasion Lord Palmerston used the following homely but apt
illustration. ‘We do not want Egypt or wish for it ourselves any more
than any rational man with an estate in the north of England and a
residence in the south would have wished to possess the inns on the north
road. All he could want would have been that the inns should be well
kept, always accessible, and furnishing him when he came with mutton
chops and post-horses.’”<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p></div>

<p>Unfortunately Egypt was anything but well governed. A thin veneer of
European civilisation barely concealed the barbaric methods of the East, and
the corruption and extravagance of her rulers were almost incredible. In
1863, her public debt was about three millions and a quarter sterling.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>
Thirteen years later, under the rule of Ismail, it had increased to sixty-eight
millions, with a floating or unfunded debt of twenty-six millions more, or
ninety-four millions in all. As the funded debt had been contracted in
Europe, chiefly in the money markets of London and Paris, and as a large
portion of the floating debt was due to European creditors, the English and
French Cabinets wrung from the Khedive a reluctant consent that European
men of business should be appointed to investigate the financial condition of
his country. In 1878, the Anglo-French committee of enquiry discovered that
the finances of Egypt were rotten to the core. For the debt of ninety-four
millions there was practically nothing to show, except the Suez canal, towards
the building of which the Government of Egypt had contributed sixteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
millions.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> There was no money to pay the interest on the bonds, and the old
method of raising a fresh loan to pay the interest on those already in
existence was obviously no longer possible.</p>

<p>In the hope that the influence of high-principled European men of
business would improve the government, the Powers insisted that the Khedive
should employ ministers of their selection. He did so, but by resolutely
obstructing the officials thus imposed upon him, he reduced the administration
to such a state of chaos that in June, 1879, the patience of England and
France was exhausted, and with the concurrence of the other Powers and
the reluctant consent of the Sultan, the Khedive was deposed in favour of his
son, Prince Tewfik. The change of viceroy did not, however, produce the
result anticipated. Affairs did not improve under Tewfik’s rule; by the end
of 1881 the population was in a ferment; a strong anti-European feeling had
arisen among the people, while the army was mutinous, and regarded not
Tewfik but Arabi, a clever and intriguing Egyptian colonel, as its master.
With the object of strengthening the Khedive’s position, England and France
in January, 1882, addressed to Tewfik a “dual note,” stating that they considered
his maintenance on the throne as the sole guarantee of good order
and prosperity in Egypt. This note, however, in no way impressed the
population; the condition of the country daily grew more unsatisfactory, and
by May a series of military demonstrations had made Arabi the virtual
dictator of Egypt, though Tewfik continued in name to be its ruler. Massacres
of Christians in various parts of the country caused an enormous
exodus of the European population,<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> trade was completely dislocated, and
the safety of the Suez canal appeared imperilled.</p>

<p>The Egyptian army, exclusive of the garrison of the Soudan, consisted of
about 9000 men actually serving with the Colours, but more than 50,000 men
had passed through the ranks into the reserve, and in the Bedouins, the dwellers
in the desert, Arabi had a further reserve, though of very doubtful value.
His artillery was powerful; exclusive of heavy guns there were forty-eight
batteries of field-artillery, not, however, fully horsed. When war broke out
the reserve men were recalled, and 40,000 recruits enlisted, who after a few
days’ drill were thrust, virtually untrained, into the ranks. Egypt was rich
in horses and camels, and in addition to the horses required for the artillery,
eleven thousand transport animals were obtained from the population.
Nominally, these beasts were the free-will offerings of their owners, but there
is reason to believe that the generosity of their donors was greatly stimulated
by the use of the <em>courbash</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>During 1881, and the first part of 1882, many communications on the
subject of Egypt had passed between the governments of England and France
and the other European Powers.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> All were agreed that order should be
restored on the banks of the Nile, but, save England and France, none
seemed disposed to undertake the task. At first France was much more
inclined to a military intervention than Britain, for England in 1882 no
more desired to annex Egypt than in 1857, when she rejected the French
Emperor’s schemes for the partition of northern Africa. But she remembered
that, even before the time of the great Napoleon, France had cast covetous
eyes upon Egypt, and as it was impossible for England to allow Egypt to be
occupied by any Continental nation, her obvious policy was to co-operate with
France, and by re-establishing order and good government in the country to
render the Egyptians capable of managing their own affairs without European
guidance. To this policy England loyally adhered until France refused to
advance further in the matter. As tangible evidence that the Western
Powers really intended to support the Khedive, an Anglo-French squadron
was sent to Alexandria, where it lay for several weeks, until our Admiral,
Lord Alcester (then Sir Beauchamp Seymour), discovered that in direct
defiance of the Khedive’s orders, Arabi was preparing to make good his threat
to attack any European troops landing in Egypt. Not only was he mounting
guns on the fortifications, but he was also attempting to prevent the British
fleet from leaving the port by secretly throwing great blocks of stone into the
entrance of the harbour. Through Lord Alcester, the British government
informed Arabi that unless he at once desisted the forts would be shelled.
Arabi promised compliance, but when the search-lights from the ships were
turned on, it was seen that under cover of night the work was being pressed
forward.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> The danger to the fleet soon grew too serious to be ignored, and
after repeated but equally fruitless warnings, notice was given to Arabi that
on the 11th of July the forts would be bombarded. Thereupon the French
Admiral announced that his instructions did not permit him to take part in
such an operation, and on the 10th he steamed out of Alexandria, leaving his
British colleague in the lurch. The forts were bombarded with complete
success, and Arabi, retiring inland for a few miles, threatened Alexandria
from a position at Kafr-el-Dauar, astride the railway to Cairo. To save the
town from pillage by its mob, and to defend it against attack by the Egyptian
army, a large number of British sailors and soldiers were landed. The troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
had just arrived from Cyprus, where, under Lieutenant-General Sir A. Alison,
a brigade, supplied by the Mediterranean garrisons, had been assembled with
secret orders to seize and protect the Suez canal against Arabi, who had
openly expressed his determination to destroy it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile preparations for an expedition were on foot in England. An
army corps drawn from the United Kingdom, the Mediterranean garrisons,
and India was to be sent to Egypt under command of Lord Wolseley (then
Lieutenant-General Sir Garnet Wolseley) with the temporary rank of General.
It consisted of a cavalry division, two infantry divisions, artillery, engineers,
and a strong contingent of British and native soldiers from India. In the
first division, under Lieutenant-General G. H. S. Willis, were the 1st, or brigade
of Guards, commanded by H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught, and the 2nd
brigade (in which was the 2nd battalion of the Royal Irish), under Major-General
G. Graham. The second division, commanded by Lieutenant-General
Sir E. Hamley, was composed of the brigades of Major-General Sir A. Alison
and Major-General Sir E. Wood. The Indian contingent, which was to join
Lord Wolseley in Egypt, was led by Major-General Sir H. T. Macpherson.
The total number of troops who embarked as part of the original army corps
were 25,309.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> The units selected for the war were mobilised; the reserve, or
to be strictly accurate, those of its members who had left the Colours within
two years were called out; transports were engaged and fitted up for troops,
and the House of Commons voted the necessary money. Suddenly the policy
of France completely veered round, and on the 29th of July, only nine days
after the French Ministry had formally engaged to take part in the expedition,
the Chamber by an enormous majority refused to spend a penny
upon the restoration of law and order in Egypt. This remarkable change of
front, which not only threw the whole expense, but the whole conduct of the
expedition upon the British, was doubtless annoying to our statesmen, but
agreeable to our generals, many of whom knew from personal experience in
China and the Crimea how difficult co-operation with our French allies had
proved in those campaigns. The defection of the French caused no alteration
in Lord Wolseley’s plans. To crush the Khedive’s mutinous army and to
restore order among his subjects it was essential that Cairo, the hot-bed of
disaffection, should be occupied as speedily as possible by British troops, and
this he proposed to do by landing, not at Alexandria, but at Ismailia, a town
on the canal half-way between Suez and Port Said. From Ismailia to Cairo
is about seventy-five miles, while from Alexandria to the capital is nearly
double that distance. By the former route the track would lie alongside a
canal of drinkable water, over hard sand which made a fair surface for
marching. In the latter route, <em>i.e.</em> through the Delta of the Nile, there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
practically no roads fit for wheeled vehicles, the local traffic being carried on
by railway, by pack animals, and by boats on the innumerable canals by
which the country is irrigated. Moreover, during the months of August,
September, and October&mdash;the time of “high Nile,” which was rapidly
approaching&mdash;the whole of the Delta is under water. Thus, of the two lines
of advance, that through the desert was obviously the better one, and it
possessed the additional advantage that the preparations for undertaking it
served to protect the Suez canal from attack, and to secure possession of the
canals by which Suez, Ismailia, and Port Said are supplied with drinking
water. It was of the first importance that Arabi should remain in complete
ignorance of the British plans; and thus the bombardment of Alexandria and
the landing of Alison’s brigade, neither of which had formed part of Lord
Wolseley’s original scheme, turned to our advantage, for the arrival of Alison’s
troops confirmed the Egyptian General in his opinion that the invading army
would disembark at Alexandria. Wolseley seized every opportunity to
strengthen him in this belief; Alison was ordered to keep Arabi constantly
in fear of an attack, and succeeded in doing so by a series of demonstrations
against the works which the rebel army had thrown up.</p>

<p>By the end of July the troops began to leave the United Kingdom: and
the second battalion of the Royal Irish regiment, almost the last corps to sail,
embarked on August 8, 1882, at Plymouth, bound, as was then believed by all
on board, for Alexandria. To enable the reader to appreciate the situation
when the battalion reached the seat of war, it is necessary to give a short
account of the events which took place while it was still at sea. On the 15th
of August Lord Wolseley arrived at Alexandria, and with his naval colleague,
Admiral Lord Alcester, settled the details of the combined operation by which
the sailors in the men-of-war already stationed in the Suez canal were to seize
and hold the towns upon its banks, until the soldiers could begin to land at
Ismailia. A considerable portion of the expedition had already disembarked
at Alexandria, and transports were daily, almost hourly, arriving from
England. The question of how these troops were to be re-embarked and
despatched to the canal without giving Arabi any clue to their destination
now had to be solved. Throughout his career as a soldier, Wolseley had
urged the necessity of deceiving your enemy in war: now he had a great
opportunity to give the British army an object lesson in the art of mystifying
an opponent, and right well did he avail himself of it. A strong believer in
the truth of the axiom that whatever is rumoured in your camp to-day will
be known to-morrow to the enemy, he determined to mislead, not only Arabi
but the whole of the British army as to his intentions. Orders were accordingly
issued for a combined naval and military attack from the sea upon the
forts at Aboukir Bay, supported by the troops left to garrison Alexandria.
Not even General Hamley, who was in command at Alexandria, was in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
secret; and with the help of his brigadiers, Alison and Wood, he worked out
elaborate details for co-operation in the advance of the main body after it had
landed at Aboukir Bay; the scheme was submitted to Wolseley and gravely
approved! At noon on the 19th of August all the troops, except those left to
hold Alexandria, were on board their ships, and eight ironclads and seventeen
transports steamed away towards Aboukir. Before his departure the Commander-in-Chief
handed a sealed packet containing his real plan to General
Hamley, with strict orders not to open it till early on the morning of the 20th.
The fleet reached Aboukir in four hours, and anchored till nightfall, when the
gunboats and other small naval craft stood inshore and engaged the forts,
while the big ships slipped away unobserved and arrived at Port Said early
next morning, to find that the navy had carried out their instructions
admirably. The sailors had surprised the detachments of the enemy watching
Port Said, Ismailia, and Suez; these places were in their hands. They were
in possession of the whole of the Suez canal. They had prevented any
vessels from entering it and, to clear the way for the transports, had ordered
all steamers then in the canal to tie up at the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gares</i> or shunting-places,
familiar to every soldier whose service has taken him east of Suez. The
merchant ships complied with three exceptions. A French mail-boat claimed
the right to pass, and was allowed to do so as a matter of international
courtesy: two English master mariners of the baser sort disobeyed, and when
the British gunboat that regulated the traffic was out of sight they followed
in the Frenchman’s wake. This incident considerably delayed the entrance
of the British fleet into the Canal, but by the evening of the 23rd, the day
before the Royal Irish reached Lake Timsah, 9000 men and a few stores had
been landed at Ismailia; the fresh-water canal and the whole line of railway
between Suez and Ismailia had fallen into our hands, and communication by
land had thus been secured with the Indian contingent, which had begun to
disembark at Suez on the 20th. Thanks to Lord Wolseley’s <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ruse de guerre</i>,
these successes had been obtained almost without bloodshed.</p>

<p>The report that Aboukir was to be bombarded duly reached Arabi, who
sent large reinforcements to the threatened forts. The Egyptians believed
that the Delta was the object of the British attack, and consequently had
concentrated the greater part of their army at the mouths of the Nile, with a
body of 12,000 men at Tel-el-Kebir, a post in the eastern desert thirty-three
miles to the westward of Ismailia. To this flank guard was allotted the duty
of defending the Delta against an enemy based on the canal, and of guarding
Zag-a-zig, the most important junction in the railway system of Egypt. By
his successful feint upon Aboukir, Wolseley prevented the despatch of reinforcements
from the Delta to Tel-el-Kebir, and thanks to the rapidity with
which the naval landing-parties had seized the telegraph lines, news of the
occupation of the Suez canal did not reach the garrison of Tel-el-Kebir in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
time to enable them to oppose our disembarkation at Ismailia. Very shortly
after Arabi heard that Wolseley had landed on the bank of the canal he
transferred his Headquarters to Tel-el-Kebir, where his Intelligence department
must have been singularly inefficient, for, “strange as it may appear, it
now seems to be certain that the great transfer of force on the 19th of August
from Alexandria to Ismailia remained unknown to Arabi till he heard of it
with evident astonishment about a year later in Ceylon,”<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> where, after the
war was over, he was detained as a political prisoner. But though the British
General had thus stolen a march upon his enemy, many difficulties still
confronted him, well described in the following extract from the official
history of the campaign.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There was only one small pier at Ismailia. Ships did not at first
anchor nearer than about half a mile from the shore. Every man, every
horse and every gun, as well as all the ammunition and stores for the
supply of the army, had first to be transhipped from the transports into
barges and small boats, rowed or tugged to shore, and then landed on the
small pier.... In no sense were the conditions for the rapid landing of
a large number of troops and of a vast quantity of stores in existence at
Ismailia. It is true that this state of things could be ultimately changed
by our engineers. But this would also be a question of time. Every
tool, every scrap of material, all the bridging stores and all the means of
constructing other piers, for laying down tramways and increasing the
pier accommodation must, by an inexorable necessity, be first landed
under the conditions actually existing. Materials for all these purposes,
including landing-stages expressly made for Ismailia, had been prepared
in England before the expedition sailed, but it would not be possible to
send them forward in the most advanced vessels of the fleet, for those
ships must be otherwise filled. In order to secure the all-important lines
of communication&mdash;the railway and Sweet-water canal&mdash;for the advance
from Ismailia, it was essential that the first vessels of the fleet should be
occupied by the troops which would be sent forward to seize them.
These troops, once sent forward, must be supplied with food and ammunition,
so that a considerable force, with all its guns and equipment, tons of
supplies, ordnance stores and ammunition and the means of local transport ... must
be sent on in the most advanced ships before any engineering
material for the improvement of the means of landing ... could
be put on shore.”<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p></div>

<p>The Egyptians had dammed the “Sweet-water” canal at Magfar, a few
miles west of Ismailia, and the water, the only supply for the towns on the
Suez canal and for the army when it moved into the desert, was falling
rapidly. While keeping every available man at work at Ismailia, Lord
Wolseley sent Graham with a small force of all arms to Magfar, and after
two days’ skirmishing, not only occupied that place, but Kassasin also, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
an important lock, twenty miles up the canal from Ismailia, fell into our
hands. Here Wolseley determined to establish an advanced base, where,
under the protection of a comparatively small force, supplies could be
accumulated in readiness for the campaign in the desert. Graham was left
in charge of this post; among his troops were two of the units of his brigade
(the 2nd), viz.: a battalion of Royal Marine Light Infantry and the 2nd
battalion, York and Lancaster regiment; the remainder of his command, the
2nd battalion of the Royal Irish regiment and the 1st battalion of the Royal
Irish Fusiliers, though they landed on the night of the 24th, did not take
part in these preliminary operations, being detained at Ismailia to help in
unloading the store-ships and transports.</p>

<p>The Royal Irish arrived from England with a total strength of seven
hundred and seventy-one, including a hundred and fifty non-commissioned
officers and men from the reserve.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> Among their fellow-passengers was a
newspaper correspondent, Major Terry, a half-pay officer, who found the
XVIIIth such good comrades that he attached himself to the battalion
throughout the war. From his account the voyage was a pleasant one, the
ship comfortable, and the troops well fed. The time passed quickly, for in
addition to the ordinary routine of life on board a transport, the officers
were hard at work reading the books on Egypt with which Colonel Gregorie
had provided himself, and lecturing to the men about the country in which
they were going to fight. The correspondent described the rank and file as
“rather under height, but a very broad-shouldered and robust body of men,
with quiet manners and pleasant to talk to. Intensely Irish, they easily
brighten into excitement in their amusements, and when their own stirring
national airs are played by the band.” At Malta the XVIIIth heard many
rumours about Lord Wolseley’s plans, but the only definite information they
received was the order to paint their helmets and belts mud-colour, and to
dull the brass-work on their uniforms. To our modern ideas the red serge
jumpers and blue serge trousers in which the expedition took the field was a
kit singularly ill adapted for a campaign in Egypt. Spine-pads and spectacles
with blue glasses were served out, but many men did not understand
the value of these novel articles of equipment, and lost them, much to their
sorrow when a few days later they found themselves in the desert exposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
the full blaze of a semi-tropical sun. On the 22nd the <i>City of Paris</i> reached
Alexandria, and was immediately ordered on to Port Said, where the battalion
found the navy in possession of the town, apparently quite as much at
home there as in Portsmouth harbour. As the ship was steaming slowly
along the canal, the Royal Irish were much entertained by a party of bluejackets,
stationed at Kantara to protect the floating bridge. The guard of
sailors turned out and presented arms in the most orthodox fashion; and
then produced a concertina and played “Rule Britannia,” dancing on the
sand and swinging their cutlasses round their heads with immense
energy.</p>

<p>On August 24, the <i>City of Paris</i> arrived at Lake Timsah, and anchored in
the midst of a great fleet of warships and transports, the latter surrounded
by steam-launches, tugs, and lighters, all busily employed in landing at
Ismailia the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">personnel</i> and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matériel</i> of the expedition. This town, a creation
of M. de Lesseps, is on the western shore of the lake, where, half-hidden in
groves of palm and plane trees, it lies like a green oasis in a desert of yellow
sand. Here the Royal Irish remained for the next four days, earning golden
opinions by the sustained energy which they displayed in carrying out the
irksome duty of moving stores from the water-side to the railway station.
Then came the welcome order to join their brigade at Kassasin. They moved
in detachments, constantly halting to help repair the railway and to clear
obstructions from the Sweet-water canal. The march was a singularly
unpleasant one: the heat was very great, the dust and flies were exasperating
to a degree, the tents had gone astray, and the only water to be had was
from the canal, which belied its name, as it was polluted by the dead
bodies of Egyptian soldiers. Several of the stations on the railway showed
traces of the recent presence of Arabi’s troops, who in their flight had
abandoned their rifles and ammunition, and left their dead unburied behind
them. There was so much work to be done on the line that it was not until
late on the 8th of September that the last companies of the Royal Irish
reached Kassasin.</p>

<p>Arabi had been misled by the lying reports of his Bedouin scouts, who
informed him that they had cut the communication between Ismailia and
Kassasin, and that the latter was held by a small force, whereas as a matter
of fact the railway from Ismailia to the front was in working order; Kassasin
was occupied by about 8000 men under General Willis, and the brigade of
Guards, a battery, and a regiment of cavalry were all within reinforcing
distance. Acting on this false information, he determined to take the
offensive, and at dawn on the 9th he put his troops in motion and pushed
from Tel-el-Kebir towards Kassasin with several squadrons of cavalry,
thirty or thirty-one guns, and seventeen battalions of infantry. His
cavalry advance-guard greatly outnumbered our mounted troops, who however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
succeeded in holding back the Egyptian horsemen, until the infantry had
taken up a position astride the canal to meet the attack now threatening
from the west and north. Covered by a vigorous but comparatively harmless
cannonade, the enemy’s infantry, a large part of which had been brought by
train, advanced towards the camp, the uniforms of the regular soldiers
contrasting strongly with the white robes of the Bedouins as they moved over
the low sandy hummocks of the desert. For a time General Willis stood on
the defensive, and the Royal Irish were detailed as the escort to the field-guns.
Then he gave orders for a general advance, and the battalion was
placed in echelon on the right rear of the first line of Graham’s brigade, ready
to form front to the right, and face the flank attack which for a moment was
anticipated. At first the battalion moved in quarter column, and then in line;
at no time during the 9th was it extended for attack, for the British guns
played so rapidly upon the Egyptians that they fell back in disorder, giving
Graham’s brigade no opportunity to close with them; and by half-past ten the
enemy had retired to his works at Tel-el-Kebir, leaving four field-pieces in
our hands. From his entrenchments Arabi opened an angry but harmless
artillery fire upon the troops, who by General Willis’s directions halted
out of range. In ceasing his pursuit at a moment when it seemed that a
vigorous, though necessarily costly attack might have made him master
of the entrenchments, General Willis was acting in perfect accord with
the spirit of Lord Wolseley’s strategy, for Alison’s brigade of infantry
had only just arrived from Alexandria at Kassasin, and the Commander-in-Chief
was not yet ready to advance across the desert. Had the
Egyptians been attacked and beaten on the 9th, Wolseley could not
have followed up the victory, and therefore their defeat would not have
been the absolutely crushing blow that he hoped to inflict (and did
actually inflict) upon them a few days later. The British troops remained
facing Tel-el-Kebir for about three hours, and thus secured time for a careful
reconnaissance of Arabi’s position; then they were ordered back to camp.
The Egyptian losses were severe, but the British casualties were only three
men killed, two officers and seventy-five other ranks wounded. Among the
wounded were Captain H. H. Edwards, Royal Welsh Fusiliers (attached to
the XVIIIth) and two private soldiers of the battalion.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> A subaltern in the
Royal Irish thus recorded the experiences of the second battalion on this
occasion: “Just as we were sitting down to breakfast the bugles sounded for
us to fall in, and a minute or two later the enemy had got so close that they
began lodging shell in our camp and made it so hot that the &mdash;&mdash; had to
clear out sharp. We were out pretty quick, and were alongside some guns
which opened on the enemy and of course drew their fire on us. For about
an hour we were in a pretty warm corner; shells burst thickly around us, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
no one was touched except two men slightly wounded. After a time we got
the order to advance, and in doing so we got a few rifle-shots among us which
did not do us any harm. Our men did not fire a shot. As we advanced the
enemy retreated. We were left to cover the retirement of the battalions who
had been in the firing line and were relieved at four o’clock in the afternoon.”</p>

<p>In a short time the Commander-in-Chief’s preparations were completed;
the whole of the troops selected for the march across the desert were concentrated
at Kassasin, and those appointed to hold the lines of communication
were at their posts. Lord Wolseley had already formed his plan of attack,
which he thus described in his despatch of the 16th of September&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The enemy’s position was a strong one; there was no cover of any
kind in the desert lying between my camp at Kassasin and the enemy’s
works north of the Canal. These works extended from a point on the
Canal 1½ miles east of the railway station at Tel-el-Kebir for a distance
almost due north of about 3½ miles. The general character of the ground
which forms the northern boundary of the valley through which the
Ismailia<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> Canal and railway run is that of gently undulating and
rounded slopes, which rise gradually to a fine open plateau from 90 to
100 feet above the valley. The southern extremity of this plateau is
about a mile from the railway and is nearly parallel to it. To have
marched over this plateau upon the enemy’s position by daylight our
troops would have had to advance over a glacis-like slope in full view of
the enemy and under the fire of his well-served artillery for about five
miles. Such an operation would have entailed enormous losses from an
enemy with men and guns well-protected by entrenchments from any
artillery fire we could have brought to bear upon them. To have turned
the enemy’s position either by the right or left was an operation that
would have entailed a very wide turning movement, and therefore a long,
difficult and fatiguing march, and what is of more importance, it would
not have accomplished the object I had in view, namely to grapple with
the enemy at such close quarters that he should not be able to shake
himself free from our clutches except by a general fight of all his army.
I wished to make the battle a final one; whereas a wide turning movement
would probably have only forced him to retreat, and would have
left him free to have moved his troops in good order to some other
position farther back. My desire was to fight him decisively where he
was, in the open desert, before he could take up fresh positions more
difficult of access in the cultivated country in his rear. That cultivated
country is practically impassable to a regular army, being irrigated and
cut up in every direction by deep canals. I had ascertained by frequent
reconnaissance that the enemy did not push his outposts far beyond his
works at night, and I had good reasons for believing that he then kept
a very bad look-out. These circumstances, and the very great reliance
I had in the steadiness of our splendid infantry, determined me to resort
to the extremely difficult operation of a night march, to be followed
by an attack before daybreak on the enemy’s position.”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>The field-works at Tel-el-Kebir were not of uniform strength, for Arabi,
believing that the British would advance along the Sweet-water canal, had
devoted himself to the fortification of the right of his line, where for more
than two miles stretched an unbroken series of breastworks, with parapets
five or six feet high, and ditches varying from eight to twelve feet in width,
and from five to nine feet in depth. Behind these defences about two miles
of interior works had been thrown up, connected with those in front by rifle-pits
and trenches, and from redoubts built at numerous salients, cross-fire
could be poured in every direction. Towards the left the works dwindled in
size, and at the extreme northern end of the line, that which, as we shall see,
was attacked by the Royal Irish, they were but a mere collection of shelter
trenches. Arabi had twenty-five thousand soldiers, six thousand Bedouin
irregulars, and about sixty guns with which to defend these fortifications
against the eleven thousand infantry, two thousand cavalry, and sixty-one
guns that the British Commander-in-Chief could bring against him. The
remainder of Wolseley’s command was absorbed by the garrisons of
Alexandria, Port Said, Ismailia, Suez, and other points on the Suez canal,
and the posts on the line of communication between Kassasin and the base
at Ismailia.</p>

<p>Though the British advance was to be astride the Sweet-water canal,
the main attack was to be delivered on the works to the north of it, where
the first division was to assault the left, the second division the right of the
entrenchments. The cavalry division, with its batteries of Royal Horse
artillery, was to circle round the left of the Egyptian position, threaten its
defenders from the rear, and pursue them when the infantry had driven them
from their entrenchments. On the south of the canal the Indian brigade and
the naval contingent were to clear the country, capture the villages which had
been placed in a state of defence, and seize the important railway junction of
Zag-a-zig. To the field batteries an interesting <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</i> was assigned. It was
obvious that in a night march they could not discharge the ordinary duty of
artillery, that of keeping in check the enemy’s fire so as to render it possible
for the attacking infantry to advance. But it was almost equally obvious
that, if the forty-two field-guns could be brought up to the entrenchments of
Tel-el-Kebir by early dawn, they would be able to pour a crushing short-range
fire upon the defenders: if either division required support the guns would be
at hand to give assistance, and should either of the infantry attacks fail, the
artillery would be ready to beat the enemy down behind his works until the
attackers were able to renew the assault. The seven field batteries therefore
were ordered to march in the interval between the infantry divisions, keeping
level with them.</p>

<p>The first and second divisions and the field artillery were assembled after
dark on September 12, on the rising ground known to the Staff as Ninth Hill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
which lay about four miles to the east of Arabi’s position. To give the
enemy’s scouts and spies no clue to the intended movements the tents were
not struck till sunset, when all bugle calls ceased. Then the troops were set
in motion, the men marching light with a hundred rounds of ammunition,
rations, and water-bottles.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> As soon as the sun went down the Royal
Engineers began to set up on Ninth Hill long lines of posts, running many
hundred yards into the desert, to serve as guides towards the enemy’s
entrenchments. The night was unusually dark, the posts were hard to find,
and it was not till eleven <span class="fs70">P.M.</span> that all the units had reached their proper
places. Graham’s brigade was on the right of the line, with its battalions
standing in the following order from the right, Royal Irish, York and
Lancaster, Royal Marine Light Infantry, Royal Irish Fusiliers: in the centre
were the field-guns: on the left was Alison’s brigade. H.R.H. the Duke of
Connaught’s brigade of Guards supported Graham, while in rear of Alison
was a small brigade of two battalions under Colonel Ashburnham, King’s
Royal Rifle Corps.</p>

<p>At 1 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span> on the 13th of September, Graham called together the officers
commanding the battalions of his brigade and in a low voice gave them
instructions, briefly and to the point: the works of Tel-el-Kebir were to be
surprised; the troops were to close upon them at earliest dawn, and carry
them at the point of the bayonet. The soldiers were then roused; the orders
were explained to them, and in half an hour the greater part of the army was
on the march to attack an enemy of nearly double its numbers, and holding
fortifications about which, except their strength, little definite was known.
The Indian brigade did not leave its resting-place, south of the Canal, until
2.30 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span>, as to have moved earlier would have run the risk of giving the
alarm to the inhabitants of the belt of cultivated land through which
Macpherson had to march. Throughout the night telegraphic communication
was kept up between the Indian brigade and a detachment of Royal Marine
artillery, who followed behind the second division. It was many years since
a British general had attempted operations at night upon so large a scale. In
the Peninsula Wellington’s troops had been thoroughly accustomed to marching
and manœuvring in darkness, but the art was now almost a lost one, and
Wolseley wisely gave great latitude to his divisional generals in the choice
of the formations in which their commands were to advance; he wished the
brigades to be so marshalled that no manœuvring would be necessary to pass
them from the order in which they marched into that in which they were to
attack, and he suggested, though without positively commanding, that each
brigade should move in line of columns of half battalions at deploying intervals.
Neither Alison nor Graham adopted the suggestion in its entirety.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Alison drew up his men in line of half battalion columns of double companies,
and not only marched but attacked in this formation; Graham first moved in
columns of half battalions at deploying intervals, but found it necessary to
make several changes in formation before he finally closed with the enemy.
Nothing but the perfect discipline of the troops enabled Lord Wolseley and
his generals to move this great mass of men and guns at dead of night,
across nearly four miles of ground which it had not been possible thoroughly
to reconnoitre, and to bring it to within a few hundred yards of the fortifications
before it was detected by the enemy. No smoking was allowed; the
men were as silent as the grave; the few orders issued were passed along the
ranks in a whisper. In the blackness of the night Staff officers riding from
flank to flank found it impossible to see a column, when two hundred yards
away from it; yet when their ears had grown attuned to the silence, which at
first appeared crushing and unnatural, they became aware of a low dull noise,
that sound of human feet, of horses’ hoofs, of jingling harness, which no
forethought could prevent. Fortunately throughout the night a little breeze
blew from west to east, and thus Arabi’s men, being up-wind, would have
heard nothing if their watch had been vigilant, instead of extremely negligent.</p>

<p>In the 2nd brigade the precaution of extending a chain of connecting links
between the half battalions did not ensure perfect leading by the guides.
Sometimes the half battalions would open out, and at others close unduly upon
each other. These mistakes had to be corrected, and each correction took
time. At an hour variously estimated between 3 and 4 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span><a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> General Willis
considered that the 2nd brigade had come within range of the Egyptian
works. He wished to rest his men for a moment, and accordingly, after
forming line, ordered a short halt. With the priceless trust of British soldiers
in their officers, the men immediately dropped on the sand and fell fast asleep
during the few minutes’ repose which they were allowed. About the same
time the Highland brigade was halted to refresh the men. As all orders
were passed in a low tone from company to company and from battalion to
battalion, this order was not at once received by the troops on the outer
flanks; they continued to advance, but as they remained in touch with the
centre they lost direction and by the time the command reached them they
had wheeled inwards, though quite unconsciously. Thus the brigade halted
not in line, but in a crescent-shaped formation. When the order was given to
resume the march the flank battalions, quite unaware that they had lost
direction, moved straight to their front, and soon almost crashed into each
other. Each thought the other was the enemy, but by a triumph of discipline,
every man waited for orders to fire, and thus gave time for the officers to
discover the mistake. The brigade was halted, the companies of direction
placed on the true line of advance, and the remainder of the Highlanders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
gradually and successively drawing back, re-formed upon the proper alignment.
This mistake, which took about twenty-five minutes to correct, is a
good example of the difficulty of night operations and the necessity of implicit
obedience to orders.</p>

<p>After a short rest Graham’s brigade again advanced, this time in line, but
the formation was found unsuitable, and was changed to an advance by fours
from the right of companies. To keep in the proper direction was no easy
matter, especially as the mass of artillery on the left was steering a few
degrees too far to the northward, and thus continually elbowed the 2nd
brigade off the right path: to correct this pressure frequent turns half-left
and half-right had to be made. Suddenly, at about 4.45 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span>, “far away to
the left was heard a tremendous rattle of musketry, mingled with the firing
of big guns, succeeded by ringing and sustained cheers, and”&mdash;to quote the
special correspondent who, as already mentioned, had attached himself to the
Royal Irish&mdash;“we felt sure that the Highland brigade had found its quest
and run into it.” At this moment it became necessary again to correct a
mistake in direction, and “a halt and change of front a quarter circle to
the left were at once ordered.... A rattling fire of small arms now opened
on us from the works, distant about 600 yards.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> It was still dusk, but the
blackness of night had given place to a pale darkness, through which the
flashes of fire sparkled with ceaseless rapidity.”</p>

<p>By this time, owing to the difficulty of marching at night over the
featureless desert with nothing to steer by but the stars, Lord Wolseley’s
force was no longer in line but in echelon from the left, and when the
Highlanders struck the enemy’s works the head of Graham’s brigade was
probably more than 800 yards from the Egyptians’ entrenchments. As soon
as the brigade had formed line the Royal Irish pushed forward, and were
rapidly nearing the position when the brigade-major, suddenly appearing
on the scene, told Colonel Gregorie it was General Graham’s wish that he
should form the Royal Irish for attack. Though it was obvious that the
battalion was too close to the trenches for the evolution to be carried out
accurately, the necessary orders were given, and C and D companies extended,
with B and E in support, and the remainder in reserve. Then the leading
companies swept onwards under a heavy but fortunately ill-directed fusilade;
the supports and reserves closed upon the firing-line, and with wild yells
and almost without firing a shot, the Royal Irish swarmed over the shelter
trenches at the extreme end of Arabi’s line, driving before them at the point
of the bayonet the Egyptians, who slowly and in good order fell back to a
second line of works in rear. The Royal Irish were now enfiladed by a
redoubt on their left flank, but taking no notice of its fire they pressed
onwards until, after driving the Egyptians from the second line of entrenchments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
they were peremptorily halted and ordered to re-form their ranks.
While this second charge was being delivered, Lieutenant Chichester made
a gallant effort to storm the redoubt with a few men; but he and two or
three of his followers fell wounded, and it remained in the hands of the
enemy until the York and Lancaster carried it with a rush. The Marines
and the Royal Irish Fusiliers gradually made themselves masters of the
works in front of them, and the Egyptians, falling into confusion, and to a
large extent abandoned by their officers who were among the first to fly,
retired in disorder. When they discovered that the British cavalry had
swung round the left of their position and were directly threatening them
from the rear, their retreat became a rout. Yet there were many among the
rank and file, especially in the regiments composed of Nubians, who had
shown bravery in the battle, and at the time it was thought that had these
men been well led they would have been formidable enemies. The justice
of this, opinion has been proved by the services of the modern Egyptian
troops in the Soudan, where regiments of Egyptian peasants and Soudanese
blacks, trained and officered by men of the regular British army, have on
many occasions acquitted themselves excellently.</p>

<p>Some interesting episodes have been recorded of the part played by
the Royal Irish in this phase of the engagement. The special correspondent
relates that as the battalion was advancing towards the first line of trenches
two men, mad with excitement, dashed out of the ranks and rushed towards
the enemy. For a moment they disappeared, but</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“presently they were seen by themselves, beyond the first works, and
in front of the big redoubt, in the very midst of the foe. These gallant
two! One was on his knee facing south-west; apparently he is conscious
of having gone beyond support. The Egyptians in their trenches
and ditches are in front, to right and to left of him. He glances back
towards where kneels, a few yards behind him, his brave companion.
But who can save you now, rash, gallant young Irishmen! You have
turned from the front of your regiment and are cut off from all aid. My
position on horseback enabled me to see the men, who, kneeling, were hid
by the trenches from their own regiment. I saw an Egyptian officer
move up behind the left of the leading man, and seizing his arm, strike
him over the head or shoulder with his sword. A struggle ensued,
but the smoke of battle hid them from further view. After the fight
Colonel Gregorie found two dead bodies of his men among the others
of his regiment in the place described: their names were Corporal Devine
and Private Milligan.”</p></div>

<p>The good conduct of other soldiers is thus described by Colonel (then
Lieutenant) Chichester&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“They stood back to back, tackled six Nubians, and accounted for
them all. I now forget their names, but I was going to recommend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
them for reward, but afterwards heard that they had been killed later in
the battle. A very brave reservist in my company was badly wounded
and lay on the ground close to where I had fallen. He had eight bullet
holes in his body, yet he only died the day that our transport full of
wounded arrived at Plymouth. When the men came to attend him on
the battlefield, he said, ‘Don’t mind me; look after others, worse hurt.’”</p></div>

<p>In sharp contrast to the gallant behaviour of this Irishman was the
treachery of an Egyptian officer who lay injured on ground occupied by
the XVIIIth. One of the men offered him water; he drank it, and then
suddenly rolled over, snatched up a rifle and shot down one of the soldiers
who were tending him. Prompt steps were taken to prevent this ruffian
from doing more mischief!</p>

<p>After pursuing for some distance, Graham halted to re-form his brigade
in readiness for further action. He had every reason to be proud of his
command, for, as he reported to Lord Wolseley, “the steadiness of the
advance of the 2nd brigade under what appeared to be an overwhelming
fire of musketry and artillery will remain a proud remembrance.” As he
rode from battalion to battalion he was greeted with many cheers, a tribute
to the leader who, though a stern disciplinarian, had ever proved himself
mindful of the comfort of his men, watchful of their safety, and who had
now led them to decisive victory. By the time the second brigade had re-formed
its ranks the troops on the left had also finished their work. The
task set to Alison’s command had proved much harder than that allotted
to Graham’s battalions. Not only were the fortifications which faced the
Highland brigade far stronger than those attacked by the second division,
but when the Highlanders had surmounted them they came under a very
heavy fire from the inner works. But thanks to the timely aid of the
guns, which pushed right into the entrenchments, the enemy was driven
back in wild confusion, and in less than an hour Arabi’s army was shattered
as completely as it had been surprised.</p>

<p>Lord Wolseley lost no time in reaping the fruits of his victory. As
soon as the enemy’s works were in his hands the cavalry were ordered to
continue their pursuit, and to strain every nerve to reach Cairo before Arabi
had been able to burn it, as he had threatened to do if he was defeated;
while the Indian brigade, which had completely driven the enemy from
the cultivated country on the southern bank of the canal, was to push on
to Zag-a-zig, and by occupying it, prevent the various detachments of
Arabi’s troops in the Delta from coming to his assistance. Both enterprises
were successful. At four o’clock on September 14, the cavalry after
a magnificent forced march began to appear before the gates of Cairo, where
Arabi, who was one of the first to quit the entrenchments of Tel-el-Kebir, had
taken refuge. Without attempting to fight, or to carry out his plan for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
the destruction of the city, he surrendered at once, and with him the garrison
of ten thousand men. The Indian brigade made itself master of Zag-a-zig,
capturing much rolling stock, in which a great portion of the infantry was
moved up to Cairo. With their arrival the war was over, and in ten days’
time every garrison in Egypt had been disarmed, and the men set free to
resume the avocations of peace.</p>

<p>Not all the British infantry, however, went on at once to Cairo. Among
the regiments left at Tel-el-Kebir was the second battalion of the Royal
Irish, who thus had plenty of opportunity to admire the fifty-eight guns
which had been taken on the 13th. In the engagement the Egyptians
are believed to have lost about two thousand killed;<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> of the number of
their wounded there is no record, but several hundred were tended by our
army doctors, while many uninjured prisoners were taken, disarmed, and
turned adrift. The British casualties were nine officers killed and twenty-seven
wounded; of the other ranks forty-eight were killed, three hundred
and fifty-five wounded, and thirty missing&mdash;in all, four hundred and
sixty-nine.</p>

<p>In the Royal Irish the losses were:</p>

</table></div>

<p>After a week at Tel-el-Kebir the Royal Irish were moved by train to
Cairo, where they were quartered in a barrack, the filth of which was so
great that to this day the remembrance stinks in the nostrils of those who
occupied it. The duty was heavy; there was much sickness among all
ranks, and beyond ceremonial parades in honour of the return of the
Khedive to the capital in which he had been reinstated by British bayonets,
nothing of interest occurred during the three weeks the battalion spent
in Cairo except a great fire, in the suppression of which it was employed.
Lieutenant W. R. B. Doran (now Colonel Doran, C.B., D.S.O.), in a letter
written at the time, thus described the part played on this occasion by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Royal Irish, who were fortunate to escape without any of the casualties
which occurred among other corps&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On the 29th of September we were startled by a tremendous bang,
followed by what sounded like a succession of cannon-shots. After an
interval there was another great explosion, more cannon-shots, and then a
rattle of musketry. We thought at first it was some kind of plot. It
turned out that a lot of trucks full of powder, unexploded shells, and
small-arm ammunition had been set on fire by another train containing
hay. How the hay was set on fire no one has yet found out. About
6.30 <span class="fs70">P.M.</span> we were turned out in a great hurry, and went to the railway
station, to stop all traffic in the streets in the neighbourhood,
and to prevent the scum from beginning to loot; they had just begun,
but they got such ‘toco’ from the ‘Tommies’ that they soon stopped
their little games. We remained guarding the streets till nearly
1 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span>, when we were relieved and began, as we thought, to march
home, but were grievously disappointed, as before we had gone half
a mile we were halted in a square and told to lie down and go to
sleep in the road. I was rather hungry, as I had not quite finished
my dinner when the order to fall in came, so I managed to get a
sort of penny bun from one of our captains, half of which I ate; the
other half I put under my head and went to sleep on the hardest bed
and strangest pillow I have ever had!”</p></div>

<p>The battalion was sent to Alexandria<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> on October 11, and a month
later Lieutenant-Colonel Gregorie, after serving his full time in command,
was succeeded by Lieutenant-Colonel R. W. E. Dawson. On February 1,
1883, the medals with clasps for Tel-el-Kebir were presented to the Royal
Irish on the racecourse of Alexandria by a veteran soldier, Field-Marshal
Lord Napier of Magdala, G.C.B., and a few days later the battalion, which
to the great satisfaction of all ranks was not included in the 10,000 troops
left to hold Egypt for the Khedive, sailed for Malta, and after remaining
there for three months, landed at Plymouth at the end of May, 1883.</p>

<p>The regiment received permission to add to its battle honours the words
“Egypt 1882” and “Tel-el-Kebir.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel C. F. Gregorie was appointed a Companion of the
Order of the Bath; Major G. W. N. Rogers and Captain J. H. Daubeney each
received a step in brevet rank; Quartermaster and Honorary Captain T.
Hamilton was made an Honorary Major; Lieutenant A. G. Chichester and
Sergeant E. O’Donnell were mentioned in despatches. The following officers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
were permitted to accept and wear decorations awarded by the Sultan, viz.:
Lieutenant-Colonel Gregorie, the Medjidie (3rd class); Major Rogers, the
Osmanieh (4th class); Captain Daubeney, Medjidie (4th class); and Lieutenant
Chichester, Medjidie (5th class), and all ranks were presented by the Egyptian
government with a decoration known as the Khedive’s Star.</p>

<p>Two officers attached to the second battalion&mdash;Captain H. H. Edwards,
Royal Welsh Fusiliers, and Lieutenant H. H. Drummond-Wolff, Royal Fusiliers,

<span class="fs55">THE NILE EXPEDITION.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">At the time of England’s armed intervention in Egypt in 1882, the Khedive’s
authority extended nominally far beyond the limits of the province which
Mahomet Ali had wrested from the Sublime Porte. The founder of the
Egyptian dynasty, not satisfied with fighting his Suzerain the Sultan in
Syria, had pushed armies up the Nile into the heart of the Soudan, or
country of the Blacks, a no-man’s land which stretched from Wadi Halfa,
the southern boundary of Egypt, to the Great Lakes far beyond the equator.
This region had no form of government; its inhabitants were oppressed by
Arab slave-hunters; its condition was pitiable in the extreme. Mahomet Ali
gradually conquered every tribe in the Nile valley up to the junction of the
White and Blue Niles, where he built Khartoum, and thrust forward outposts
in every direction from the capital of his new dominions, which was about a
thousand miles south of Cairo. The country thus annexed became known as
the Egyptian Soudan, and extended from the shore of the Red Sea to the
western frontier of Kordofan; it was about the size of France and Germany
put together, and its population in 1883 was estimated at fourteen millions of
mixed breed, the descendants of the aboriginal negroes and the Arabs who
overran the country early in the Mohammedan era. This blend had produced
a race possessing the outward characteristics and mental attributes of the
Arab, combined with the endurance and brute courage of the Negro.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> After
anarchy such as had prevailed in the Soudan, almost any form of government
might have been expected to improve the condition of the country; but in
this respect Egyptian rule completely failed. Taxation was heavy; extortion
was the rule, rather than the exception, and slave-hunting, with all its
attendant horrors, was not suppressed; indeed, thanks to the connivance of
the officials, who were virtually in partnership with the slave-dealers, it so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
greatly increased that the country was rapidly becoming depopulated, when
in 1869, the pressure of British public opinion compelled the Khedive to
institute reforms in the administration, and to appoint an Englishman, Sir
Samuel Baker, as Governor-General of the Equatorial provinces, which
stretched from Khartoum to the Great Lakes. Five years later Baker was
succeeded by General (then Colonel) Charles George Gordon, who held the
post till 1879. Though both accomplished much towards the establishment
of better government and the suppression of slave-hunting, their efforts were
cramped and thwarted by the officials at Cairo and at Khartoum, who were
naturally disinclined to lose the enormous profits they derived from the trade
in slaves. A country so mercilessly treated only needed a leader to turn
upon its oppressors, and in 1881, such a leader arose in the Soudan. A
prophecy had long been current among Mohammedans that about this time
a “Mahdi” would appear and convert the whole world to the true faith,
and of this prophecy a religious adventurer, named Mohammed Ahmed,
availed himself to the uttermost. He proclaimed himself the Mahdi whose
advent had been predicted, and announced that as soon as the Soudan had
joined his cause he would march on Egypt, destroying all who opposed him,
and convert the whole world to Islam. Such was the spiritual part of his
programme, carefully prepared to rouse the fanaticism latent in every
Mohammedan; the temporal advantages he offered to his followers were
universal equality and community of goods. Although denounced as an
impostor by the educated Mussulmans, who probably regarded his socialistic
propaganda with misgivings, he rapidly gained a great following, and
obtained several successes over the Egyptian garrisons, which were at this
time in a wretched condition. The troops had not been paid for many
months, in some cases even for years: the soldiers were undrilled, their
officers incompetent to drill them: the loyalty of all ranks was as doubtful
as their courage. To stiffen this unpromising material, several Englishmen
in the service of Egypt were sent to Khartoum; among them
was Hicks Pasha, at one time an officer in the Indian army, now the
newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Khedive’s troops in the
Soudan.</p>

<p>In September, 1883, Hicks, acting under the orders of the Egyptian
government, led an expedition into the depths of Kordofan, where the Mahdi
had retired to organise the tribesmen, from thirty to sixty thousand strong,
whom his recent victories had attracted to his standard. Hicks commanded
about 11,000 weakly and ill-fed men, of whom many were so unwilling to be
soldiers that to prevent desertion they had to be sent up the Nile in chains.
His artillery consisted of thirty-six Krupp, Nordenfelt, and mountain guns,
and his transport was supplied by six thousand horses and camels. The
whole of the Egyptian troops were thoroughly out of heart; they were aware
that they were about to march into a country of which little was known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
except that it was almost waterless, and that they would encounter hordes
of desperate and ruthless fanatics. As the men filed out of Khartoum they
were in floods of tears. The fate of such an army may easily be imagined:
on the 5th of November it was surprised by the Mahdi with 40,000 of his
followers, and cut to pieces, near El Obeid in Kordofan.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> Hicks and the
other Europeans died fighting dauntlessly to the last; the Egyptians allowed
themselves to be butchered almost without resistance: three hundred were
given quarter, only to become the slaves of the victors, into whose hands
passed the guns, much ammunition, thousands of rifles, and all the transport
animals. One man alone escaped to bring the news to Khartoum. Yet so
little was the importance of the Mahdist movement appreciated by the
English government that at the very time Hicks’s column was being destroyed
in Kordofan, Mr Gladstone was urging the reduction of the British
army of occupation in Egypt. When Hicks’s fate became known in Cairo
the situation grew very complicated. The Cabinet in London, afraid of being
drawn into armed intervention in the Soudan, had persistently assumed an
attitude of aloofness on the subject of Hicks’s operations, and, affecting to
ignore the fact that Britain was virtually, though not officially, mistress in
Egypt, and that a word from her representative at Cairo, Lord Cromer
(then Sir Evelyn Baring), would have stopped the expedition, declined all
responsibility on the ground that it had been undertaken solely on the
authority of the Egyptian government. The annihilation of Hicks’s army
had placed Khartoum in a position of great danger: only two thousand
troops were left to man the four miles of earthworks by which the town
was ringed, and its communications with Cairo and Suakim were seriously
threatened. The generals in command of the British army at Cairo admitted
that, if the Mahdi advanced on Khartoum, it would be impossible to hold it
in its existing condition, and that in all probability the whole valley of the
Nile, as far south as Wadi Halfa, would be lost to Egypt. Alarmed at the
crushing blow which had befallen him, and at the consequences likely to
follow it, the Khedive begged that British troops might be sent to the
Soudan, or, if these should not be forthcoming, that a contingent of Turks
might be imported to hold Khartoum. Our government refused to move a
single soldier to the Soudan, but had no objection to the employment of a
Turkish force to garrison Khartoum, provided that no expense was thereby
thrown upon the Egyptian Treasury. They, however, advised Tewfik to
abandon all territory south of Assouan, softening the blow by the promise
that England would defend not only Egypt proper, but also the ports of the
Red Sea against the Mahdists. To this wholesale dismemberment of his
dominions the Khedive demurred, and again suggested a Turkish occupation
of the Soudan, whereupon England sternly replied that if the Egyptian
ministers would not carry out the evacuation of the Soudan they would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
to make room for Englishmen, ready to enforce her policy. The Khedive
thereupon withdrew his opposition, and agreed that the whole of the Soudan,
except the port of Suakim, should be abandoned to its fate. During these
negotiations the situation at Khartoum had become so serious that the senior
European officer there, in reporting that it would be impossible to hold the
town against the whole population of the Soudan, which had now thrown in
its lot with the Mahdi, urged that immediate orders should be given for a
withdrawal down the river. The question next arose&mdash;who was to effect the
withdrawal, not only of the troops, but also of the officials, traders, and other
members of the civil army of occupation in the Soudan?</p>

<p>The English ministers then bethought themselves of General Gordon, one
of the most remarkable characters of the nineteenth century. His career had
been a strange and eventful one. After serving with distinction as a Royal
Engineer in the Crimea, the chances of war carried him to the Far East
where he played his part in the Anglo-French expedition to China. When
the object of the campaign was accomplished, peace was signed with the
Emperor of China, but the end of the war found some of the most fertile
provinces of the Celestial Empire in the hands of great hordes of insurgents,
with whom the Chinese authorities were wholly unable to cope.
Gordon was lent to the Emperor to command a force of Chinamen, raised
by himself and officered by adventurers of mixed nationality. With a rare
combination of military talent and personal courage, readiness to assume
responsibility, power of influencing his subordinates, and complete absence of
self-seeking, he welded his unpromising material into good soldiers, with
whom he stormed many walled towns and won battles innumerable against
vastly superior numbers. After a long struggle, in which his men earned the
title of “the ever-victorious army,” he completely crushed the rebels; and
then, disbanding the troops who had learned to look upon him as invincible,
he returned to Europe with the justly earned reputation of a born leader of
men. During his five years’ sojourn in the Soudan Gordon had acquired
great influence over its inhabitants. The fighting men had learned to follow,
the slave-hunters to fear him: the traders respected his stern and evenhanded
justice: all classes knew that his word, once pledged, was never broken, and
that his orders must be obeyed to the letter. At a few hours’ notice, Gordon
was sent to Egypt to secure the retreat of the garrison of Khartoum and of
the thousands of civilians who would probably wish to accompany it, and
also to effect the evacuation of the remainder of the Soudan. For this
enormous task he was allowed one Staff officer, Colonel D. Stewart,<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> 11th
Hussars, with whom he reached Khartoum on February 18, 1884.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>While Gordon was on his way up the Nile, the tide of war was setting
strongly against the Egyptians in the eastern Soudan, where a wing of the
Mahdi’s army was commanded by Osman Digna, an ex-slave dealer who had
been ruined by the capture of his <em>dhows</em> by British cruisers. Osman Digna
had stormed several fortified towns and villages, held by the Khedive as
outposts round Suakim, and had cut to pieces columns of Egyptian troops
sent at various times to the relief of the garrisons scattered throughout the
district. Suakim itself was threatened, and the ships of war then lying off
the port landed bluejackets and Marines for its protection, while Major-General
Sir Gerald Graham was sent from Cairo to reinforce them with 4000
British troops. There were two sharp engagements at El-Teb (February 29)
and Tamai (March 13), in which Osman Digna fought with magnificent
courage, but sustained such heavy losses that his power for evil appeared
sufficiently diminished to warrant the withdrawal of the British soldiers from
the eastern Soudan.</p>

<p>While these events were taking place round Suakim, things were going
badly with Gordon at Khartoum, and though direct telegraphic communication
with him was cut off about a month after his arrival, the news which reached
Cairo showed that his position was becoming one of considerable danger. In
April, the Secretary of State for War began to realise that it might become
necessary to send an expedition to rescue Gordon, and called upon Lord
Wolseley for a plan of campaign. In his reply Wolseley showed that
Khartoum could only be approached by the caravan roads converging on
Berber from the Red Sea or by the valley of the Nile, and strongly advocated
the latter route. He proposed to move the dismounted troops up the river in
boats, and after pointing out that Gordon’s supplies would not permit him to
hold Khartoum later than the 15th of November, urged that immediate
preparations should be made to meet possible contingencies. For several
months government took little action beyond making inquiries about the
track across the desert from Suakim to Berber, and sending naval officers up
the Nile to report whether Lord Wolseley’s scheme was practicable. These
officers reported against it, and Sir F. C. A. Stephenson, the General commanding
the British troops in Egypt, agreed with their views. On the other
hand, a committee composed of three officers who had taken part in the Red
River expedition in Canada emphatically expressed their opinion that
Wolseley’s plan was perfectly feasible, and pointed out that the naval
objections to it were based on the assumption that steamers of considerable
size, and boats up to 40 tons burden would be required, whereas the
army only asked for whale-boats, which could be used at any state of the
Nile.</p>

<p>While these discussions were going on, the tide of Mahdism steadily
flowed northwards. To meet a possible attack upon Egypt proper, the bulk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
of the Khedive’s army, then in process of reorganisation by British officers,
was hurried to Assouan, where it was strengthened by English battalions;
the Nile was patrolled by steamers manned by the navy; and irregular levies
of Bedouins, also commanded by British officers, were pushed up the river into
Dongola, the most southern portion of the Egyptian dominions in which the
authority of the Khedive was still recognised. Dongola was ruled by a Mudir
who, though originally in sympathy with the Mahdi, had been won back by
golden arguments to the cause of his Suzerain. In the course of the summer
his territory was attacked; it was considered necessary to help him with
British bayonets, and the 1st battalion of the Royal Sussex regiment was
moved southwards from Assouan. On the 8th of August, only eight days
before the Royal Sussex reached the town of Dongola, a vote of credit was
obtained from the House of Commons to cover the expense of sending troops
to the assistance of the Mudir; but though by this vote government definitely
committed itself to the Nile route, and therefore to the use of small boats, it
was not until the 12th that official sanction was given for the construction of
these craft. Four hundred were then ordered, and in a few days the number
was doubled. The boats were to carry twelve men with their equipment,
ammunition, and rations; to be suitable alike for rowing, sailing before a
wind, and tracking (<em>i.e.</em>, being hauled up stream from the bank), for ascending
and descending rapids, and for passing over shallow and rocky places in the
river: to be as light as possible, yet strong enough to be dragged over short
stretches of ground to avoid cataracts; and to be 32 feet in length, 6 feet
9 inches in breadth, and only 2 feet 6 inches in depth. The first consignment
reached Alexandria on September 22, the last on October 18, 1884.</p>

<p>It had not been proposed to employ Lord Wolseley in the expedition, but
on August 26, he was appointed to command the troops upon the Nile. He
reached Cairo on September 9, when there were actually in Egypt, or on
their way thither, a regiment of cavalry, one battery of Royal Horse artillery,
one of Royal Field artillery, one camel battery of mountain guns, and
two garrison batteries; four companies of Royal Engineers, one of which was
at Suakim; a battalion of mounted infantry, 423 strong; and thirteen and a
half battalions of infantry&mdash;in all, nearly 11,000 officers and men, among
whom were the first battalion of the Royal Irish regiment. Not all these
troops, however, were available for the actual operations at Khartoum when
that far-distant goal should be approached. The garrisons of Cairo and
Alexandria absorbed four and a half battalions of infantry, a squadron of
cavalry, and all the artillery except the mountain guns. Though the
Egyptian army held the line of communication from Cairo to Hannek, it
was considered necessary to strengthen this section with a British battalion,
while to secure the Nile between Hannek and Berber, at least five battalions
would be required. Lord Wolseley aimed at placing about 5400 men in
line at Shendi, a place on the river about 100 miles south of Berber, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
the same distance to the northward of Khartoum, and after making allowance
for the inevitable wastage of troops in an expedition such as he was to
conduct, and for the possibility that he might have to send part of his column
on a sudden dash across the desert, he asked the War Office to supply him
with eleven hundred more men, volunteers from regular regiments at home, to
be turned into “camelry”&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>, infantry mounted upon camels. The request
was granted, and these reinforcements arrived in time to reap a large share of
the honours of the campaign.</p>

<p>Before any troops could be moved to Shendi, through a country from
which little or no food could be obtained, it was necessary to form an
advanced base as high up the river as possible, where stores of all kinds
were to be collected before the main body began to arrive from Cairo. It was
also necessary to establish along the line of communication on the river a
chain of intermediate depôts, from which the troops would draw rations and
thus preserve intact the cargo of stores with which each whale-boat was to be
freighted. Korti was selected for the advanced base, and there, when the
first thousand miles of its journey from the sea was accomplished, the
expeditionary force was to effect its preliminary concentration.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> As far
as Wadi Halfa, about 750 miles above Cairo, the navigation of the Nile
presents no great difficulties, and every available river steamer and river boat
was pressed into the service. But above Wadi Halfa a formidable series of
cataracts, or rapids as they should more accurately be termed, proved fatal to
so many of the native craft that the transport of stores to the higher reaches
had almost entirely to be carried out by the whale-boats. It was not until
the 1st of November that a sufficient quantity of supplies had been sent up
the river to warrant Lord Wolseley in moving the main body of his infantry.
Then as speedily as possible each corps was despatched in turn on
its journey southward. Towards the end of December the first battalion of
infantry reached Korti, where the camelry, who had marched along the
banks of the Nile, were beginning to assemble; in about four weeks more
the last regiments arrived, and by the end of January the preliminary
concentration had been successfully accomplished.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>While the second battalion was winning fresh honours for the regiment
at Tel-el-Kebir, the first battalion was in India. It was stationed at Meerut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
in August, 1884, when the welcome order was received to start for Egypt
forthwith on active service. In high spirits at the prospect of a campaign,
all ranks worked with a will; by the 20th the preparations were finished,
and the Royal Irish, after a very hot railway journey, embarked at Bombay
on the 29th, and three weeks later arrived at Cairo in magnificent order.
They are described by an officer who was then serving with the regiment&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When the 1st battalion Royal Irish landed in Egypt in 1884, it
was, bar none, the finest battalion I have ever seen, both in physique
and in general appearance. Under Colonel M. MacGregor they were
considered to be the best dressed regiment in India, and since his
departure they had lived up to their reputation. In this respect they
presented a very marked contrast to many of the battalions in Egypt,
who were dressed in a very hideous grey serge very similar to that
worn by convicts, which was worn apparently exactly as it had been
issued from store. Their physique was equally distinguishable from the
Corps who had lately arrived from home. The average service was (if
I remember right) about seven years, and the average height, taken
from the annual return prepared at Wady Halfa, was 5.7¾, and the chest
measurement was 38″. While we were at Cairo a gymkhana was
held at Gezireh, where one of the events was a tug-of-war open to all
troops in garrison. The Royal Garrison artillery for some time past
had invariably won this contest: so invincible were they considered
that no infantry regiments would compete against them, and they used
to take the prize on every occasion with a ‘walk-over.’ On the arrival
of the Royal Irish, we determined to enter our team, which had been
practically unbeaten in India. On the day of the gymkhana the R.G.A.
expected to have another ‘walk over,’ when to their surprise and to that
of the spectators (we had kept the fact dark that we intended to enter a
team), ten strapping Royal Irishmen, in jerseys of the regimental colours,
stepped out on to the ground. The gunners were so unprepared for this
that they hadn’t even taken the trouble to be suitably dressed for a tug-of-war.
So confident were they of beating all comers that instead of the
usual line they had arranged an open ditch filled with water, across
which the opposing teams had to pull. It was not many minutes before
the two leading gunners were in the water, and the rest, to save
themselves a ducking, had to let go the rope!”</p></div>

<p>The Royal Irish were almost the last troops to leave lower Egypt; but at
length the long-expected order reached them, and on the evening of November
12, 1884, they entrained for Assiut, the farthest point to which the railway
ran up the Nile. The marching-out state showed a strength of seven hundred
and forty-six officers and men.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>Next morning, after a journey of 229 miles, the Royal Irish arrived at
Assiut, and at once exchanged the train for the barges in which they were
to be towed 318 miles to Assouan, at the foot of the First Cataract. The
men were packed into four barges, in each of which a subaltern was on duty
for twenty-four hours at a time; the remainder of the officers were divided
among the steamers and a <em>dahabiah</em>. “That night the halt was not sounded
till 10 o’clock, when,” wrote a young officer of the Royal Irish, “a nice job we
had of it. Our steamers did not keep together, so that we had to go along the
bank for about a mile in the dark, and draw rations for the next day, and
very ticklish work it was, as the path was quite close to the river and bits of
the bank were continually falling in.” Progress was slow, for both barges
and tugs occasionally ran on to sandbanks, and it was not until November 24,
that the flotilla, which had been joined by the 2nd battalion, Royal West Kent
regiment, reached its destination. As the barges could not pass the rapids
the Royal Irish landed, and spent an unhappy day in the belief that they
were to remain at Assouan. They had been ordered to encamp, and some
of the officers were on their way to select the ground, when a tremendous
roar of cheers and Irish yells told them the battalion had received good news;
shortly afterwards a staff-officer informed them that they were to proceed up
the river forthwith, and after a short journey in the railway turning the
rapids, the Royal Irish re-embarked at Shellal, this time in the sailing-boats
or <em>dahabiahs</em> in which the traffic of the Nile from time immemorial has been
carried on. The next stage (210 miles) in the voyage was to Wadi Halfa,
the frontier town of Egypt, and the most southern point which Roman
legions had occupied in the valley of the Nile. Here a long stretch of rapids
called the Second Cataract barred the passage of all local craft at that time
of year, and the troops landed and went into camp, where owing to a block
on the line of communication the battalion was detained for more than a
fortnight. This halt was by no means a restful one, for the fatigues were
incessant, but some of the officers found time to reconnoitre the nearest of
the rapids through which they were about to pass, and reported that a task
awaited the XVIIIth as arduous in its way as any that had fallen to the lot
of the regiment during the two centuries of its existence. The Second
Cataract, like that at Assouan, is turned by a line of railway thirty-three
miles in length, which ended at Gemai, where, in an improvised dockyard,
the whale-boats lay waiting for the Royal Irish. By December 16, the line
of communication was again clear, and the first detachment&mdash;B and E<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
companies under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Wray&mdash;were sent by
rail to Gemai, where they took possession of their “whalers,” and many
stores. When these were packed the flotilla started in single file, and sometimes
sailing, sometimes rowing (with many different strokes and styles),
worked up a smooth stretch of river till nightfall, when the boats were
tied up to the bank, and the crews disembarked and pitched their camps.
Next morning the detachment reached Sarras, where the remainder of the
stores were issued. Each whaler carried the arms, ammunition, tents, and
camp equipage of her crew, materials for repairing any damage she might
sustain on the voyage, and cases containing a hundred days’ rations for
twelve men. These cases were not to be opened, but were to be delivered
intact at the point of concentration, the supplies for current use being drawn
at the various posts on the line of communication. By the time the whole
of the freight (about four tons) was on board the boats, the load of boxes
at stem and stern rose so high above the gunwales that the men at the
oars were half-hidden behind the high-piled cargoes.</p>

<p>Lord Wolseley had always attributed much of the success of the little
Red River expedition to the skill of the boatmen, or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voyageurs</i> who navigated
his canoes over the waterways of Canada. With some difficulty he induced
the British government to sanction the enrolment of a corps of Canadian
boatmen for the much larger expedition of 1884; nearly four hundred officers
and men were raised, many of whom proved themselves as valuable on the
Nile as their predecessors had been on the rivers of Ontario and Manitoba.
These <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voyageurs</i> joined the whalers at Sarras: they were placed in charge
of the actual handling of the boats, but, except as watermen, they had no
authority. The flotilla as a whole was in charge of the regimental officers,
who were distributed among the whalers, but in every company many boats
were necessarily commanded by sergeants and even by corporals. In most
cases the non-commissioned officers were as ignorant of boat work as their
men, and with their crews had to learn by experience the use of oars and
sails, the employment of poles to prevent the whalers from being dashed
against the rocks, and the art of tracking. Even the best of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voyageurs</i>,
though experts in other branches of boatmanship, knew nothing of sails,
which were not used in the navigation of the rivers with which they were
familiar. In the forenoon of December 18, B and E companies pushed off
from Sarras, followed by the remainder of the battalion, less G company,
which next day brought up the rear. Thus the whole battalion was now
afloat, engaged in a ceaseless struggle with the rapids of the Nile, and greatly
handicapped by want of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voyageurs</i>, of whom the supply had run so short that
instead of a couple of Canadians being posted to each boat, as had been the
case with the corps first up the river, only two could now be allotted to each
company of the Royal Irish. The difficulties encountered, as will be seen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
were enormous, but the first battalion of the Royal Irish overcame them
with brilliant success, and made the passage up the river faster than any
other corps in the expeditionary force. In order to “get the last ounce”
of work out of his troops, Lord Wolseley appealed to both the sporting and
the patriotic instincts of his soldiers by offering a prize of £100 to the
non-commissioned officers and men of the battalion which made the fastest
run with the fewest accidents from Sarras to Debbeh, and by promising
that the winning corps should be selected for the post of honour in the
farther advance towards Khartoum. The money prize was awarded to the
Royal Irish, who thus won the right to share in the hardships of the march
across the desert to Metemmeh. Before that march is described, some account
must be given of the portion of the Nile up which the Royal Irish had to
force their way before they could hope to strike a blow for the relief of
Gordon. For eighty miles above Sarras the river runs through a wild and
barren region known as Batn-el-Hájar or the Womb of Rocks, of which the
official historian gives the following description:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“After leaving Sarras the first serious obstacle to navigation is the
cataract of Semneh, the foot of which is reached after an eleven miles’
pull against a smooth, swift current running between high rocky banks.
Then come ten miles of swifter-flowing water, against which, however,
with the help of a moderate breeze, it is possible to proceed with the help
of the track lines. At the head of this rapid is the great ‘Gate of
Semneh,’ a narrow gorge, between two rocky cliffs, partly blocked by two
islands about equi-distant from the shores and from each other. Through
the three passages thus formed the whole pent-up volume of the Nile
rushes as through a sluice-gate. Here the boats have to be unloaded, and
their cargoes, package by package, carried for half a mile over the rocks
and deposited near smooth water above the cataract. Then the track
lines are passed round the rocks, and two or three boats’ crews manning
one line, each boat is in turn hauled by main force up the water slide and
run in opposite its cargo on the beach.</p>

<p>“For the next sixteen miles the course of the river is unimpeded by
any serious obstacle, still for every yard the current runs as strong as
the Thames in flood, on every side the basalt mountains radiate their
heat, and everywhere the sunken rocks lie in wait for the unwary
steersman. At the end of this distance the cataract of Ambako is
reached, a very different piece of water to that of Semneh. At the
latter spot an obstacle to navigation was formed by the volume of the
Nile being pent into a narrow gorge; at Ambako the same effect is
produced by a broad expanse of river being choked by an innumerable
mass of reefs and islets. At full high Nile, when the lower rocks are
buried deep beneath the surface, the cataract is not a formidable one;
but as the river falls and reef after reef makes its appearance, the
difficulties of navigation increase, until at low Nile the cataract has
become impassable for the larger native craft, and is a grave source of
difficulty even to the buoyant English whalers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here every means of propulsion has to be employed. At one
moment the whalers, under the lee of some islet, may be paddled gently
up a narrow lane of almost stagnant water. Then, as the shelter of the
rock is lost, though its crew pull for dear life, it is carried back some
hundreds of yards until a point of vantage is reached near the shore.
Next the track line is got out, and step by step the boat is hauled round
a projecting point by a treble boat’s crew. Now a fresh breeze and a
clear reach of moderate water make it just possible to gain a few
hundred yards by making the very most of sails and oars; then a bit
of shelving shore is met with, along which good progress may be made
by half the crew tracking, while the remainder stay on board and use
their punt-poles. At length, by dint of perseverance, the five miles of
rapid are surmounted in twice as many hours of incessant labour, and
another eight miles of open water are entered on.”<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p></div>

<p>Though no two cataracts are exactly alike, their general features are
much the same, and therefore it is enough merely to mention the others
passed by the XVIIIth. Above the rapids of Ambako came the cataract of
Tanjur, which, though only two miles and a half long, usually took the boats
a whole day to ascend, and fifteen miles higher up was another rapid, nearly
as troublesome as that of Semneh. This was succeeded by ten miles of
smooth water running between hills crowned with ruins, relics of a nation
so ancient that its very name has been forgotten. Then followed the cataract
of Dal, round which stores had to be carried for three or four miles by hand;
these rapids once passed, the boats entered a long reach of calm but swift-running
water 100 miles in length, at the head of which two more cataracts,
those of Kaiber<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> and Hannek, had to be surmounted. From Hannek to
Korti the navigation of the Nile was fairly easy.</p>

<p>The record of the forty days spent by the battalion between Sarras and
Korti is one of unceasing toil. The Royal Irish worked like galley slaves.
From dawn to dark, in burning and daily increasing heat, they rowed, and
poled, and hauled the boats by ropes through the easier portions of the rapids.
In the more difficult places it became necessary to lighten the whalers, and
the crews had to unload them partially or entirely and to transport the cargo
across the rocks, work the boats through the broken water, and then carefully
repack them, with the knowledge, acquired by bitter experience, that an hour
or two later the performance would have to be repeated. Occasionally, to
avoid some especially bad piece of river, the boats had to be emptied, lifted
out of the water, and hauled across country on the rollers provided for the
purpose. Sometimes a boat missed the narrow passage among the rocks
which barred her way, and was whirled backwards down the current until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
the men on the banks, hanging on to the drag ropes with their arms almost
wrenched from the sockets, succeeded in hauling her into slack water.
Occasionally a whaler was wrecked; nearly every day and sometimes several
times in the day one or more were injured by striking against submerged
rocks, and in default of professional boat-builders the officers had to repair
the damage themselves. Major-General (then Captain) Burton Forster’s
diary contains many references to his labours as a shipwright, and a few are
quoted almost at random, to show what “handy men” the officers of the
XVIIIth became in the expedition of 1884-85. “Found Sergeant Evans’s boat
again broken at a small rapid. Stopped, and put in a plank about nine feet
long, as the original one was cracked all that distance.” ... “Got all the ten
boats of my Company up rapids by dark and beached them for repairs.” ...
“Four-fifths of the keel torn off Corporal &mdash;&mdash;’s boat, mended her.” The
work went on for seven days a-week; there was no rest on Sundays, or even
on Christmas day, the entry for which runs&mdash;“Divine service for Roman
Catholics, then drew boats up main rapids, kept moving, and unloaded in the
evening.” In less arduous circumstances the voyage up the Nile would have
proved a pleasant experience, for the scenery possesses a weird beauty of its
own, wholly unlike that of any other part of the world; the climate is
glorious, and the endless series of ruins which line the banks interesting in
the extreme. But the officers of the Royal Irish had no time to admire scenery,
or to study the archæology of the ancient Egyptians. They had suddenly
been turned into fresh-water sailors; they had become jacks-of-all-trades&mdash;shipwrights,
doctors, dock labourers; they had to maintain discipline, to keep
up <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">morale</i>, and to cheer the men when under the strain of unceasing toil even
their buoyant spirits for a moment flagged.</p>

<p>An officer of the regiment thus records his reminiscences of the boat work
on the Nile&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Greatcoats and nothing else was the favourite kit with the men of
my boat, who prided themselves on their dress and were anxious to save
one good suit of khaki in which, they said, they would march into
Khartoum. It was a handy costume when you stuck on a sandbank or
struck upon a rock, as you could be overboard in a second to shove the
boat off. Very often my men used to row in their ‘birth-day suits’!
Just before we started up the Nile I had been transferred to a new
company, and my skipper<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> left the detailing of the crews of the boats to
the Colour-Sergeant, who took advantage of my youth and innocence (?)
to put into my boat ten of the biggest blackguards in the company, and
a really good corporal of the old stamp (Corporal George M‘Kee).
Though I was new to the company, my future boat’s crew were well
known to me by name and sight as being constant attenders at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
Orderly Room, so I thought a ‘few kind words’ would do them no
harm, and consequently informed them that I knew them well, but that
we were going to have no d&mdash;&mdash;d nonsense in my boat, or out of it they
would go to sink or swim! A grin of amusement was all the answer
I got to my short speech.</p>

<p>“When we started off the Corporal and I were the only two men
who had ever handled an oar in their lives. Luckily the Corporal was
a good tough nut, and had been stroke in the regimental boat some
years previously when we were in Malta. That first day’s row is still a
nightmare to me. We left Sarras at 12 noon, the Corporal and I doing
the rowing, while the remainder did their best to imitate us, but only
succeeded for the most part in ‘catching crabs.’ The current for the
Nile was slight&mdash;but except quite close in-shore it ran at about 3 miles
an hour. Unfortunately our Cox, never having handled a tiller before,
kept alternately running us out into the stream or into the banks. The
distance from Sarras to Gemai was only 12 or 14 miles, but we did not
get there till 8 <span class="fs70">P.M.</span>, and I thought we should never get there. I was
more dead-beat than I have ever been before or since, and once I had
thrown myself on to the sand when we eventually reached Gemai, I
could not have gone another yard. However, youth and a sound sleep
worked wonders, and next morning I was as fit as a fiddle, and started
loading up the food stuff&mdash;a job requiring a lot of time and care, as each
box had to be fitted into its place like blocks in a Chinese puzzle. With
the stores, we also took in one or two Canadian <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voyageurs</i> per company.
My company had two. Regiments who had preceded us had had a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voyageur</i> for each boat, but a good many of them had become ‘fed up’
and had gone home or to Hospital, and by the time the Royal Irish went
up the river, the supply only ran to about one or two for every 10 or 12
boats.</p>

<p>“I was given a French Canadian, and the company tool chest, and
told to bring up the rear&mdash;a pleasant task which meant I had to go to
the assistance of any boat in difficulties on a rock or sandbank, come last
into the night’s halting-place, and when there sit up most of the night
mending the ‘lame ducks’ of the fleet. The actual mending did not take
so long, as we soon learnt to patch up holes and tears, but the repairs
usually involved the unloading of the boat, and fitting together the
‘Chinese puzzle’ of boxes in the dark was an operation that took two or
three hours.</p>

<p>“My Canadian was a very fine specimen of his class, and had a flow
of bad language&mdash;both French and English&mdash;that I have seldom heard
surpassed or even equalled. Owing to my being able to talk a certain
amount of French, we became very good friends, and under his instruction
I became an expert <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voyageur</i> both at the helm and with the pole in
the bows, and could have taken a boat up any of the rapids. Though we
were such good friends, it did not prevent him ‘doing me in the eye.’
Each boat had a box labelled ‘Medical comforts,’ which was on no
account to be opened. Very foolishly the authorities had a printed label
on the box showing its contents, which in addition to beef-tea, arrowroot,
&amp;c., also consisted of 2 bottles of brandy and two of port wine. It
had been reported that no box of medical comforts had reached its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
destination intact. I determined that my boat should be the exception,
so the box was put in the stern of the boat, so that I could keep my eye
on it during the day while I pulled stroke, and at night I slept on it
in the boat. Never did it go out of my sight except at the portages,
when my friend George, the Canadian, volunteered to carry it for
safety’s (?) sake. I drew the line at carrying boxes at portages, and
trusted George. When, however, my box was examined on arrival at
Korti, though it appeared quite untouched, the liquor was all gone, the
arrowroot, &amp;c., were, however, quite complete; George had no use for
<em>them</em>!</p>

<p>“It was marvellous how quickly the men took to rowing. In a few
days they were pulling powerful if not stylish oars, and they certainly
put their hearts and their backs into it. My crew of blackguards were
simply splendid, and we never had any difference of opinion. On one
occasion we came to a very stiff bit of water, and I turned round and
said, ‘Now, boys, we’ll have to pull here,’ and the man behind&mdash;one of
the biggest and sturdiest scamps in the battalion, said, ‘Begorra, sir, we’ll
pull to hell wid you,’ and a voice from the bows added, ‘and out the
other side, sir.’</p>

<p>“The Nile sores were the things that troubled us most; any scratches
or in many cases ordinary rowing blisters, turned into festering sores
which nothing could cure so long as we remained on the river. I took
the skin off my ankle shoving the boat off a rock, and tho’ I kept it
perfectly clean, and put vaseline on it, it would not heal. The strange
thing was that once we got into the desert, tho’ we could not wash,
these sores all began to heal at once.</p>

<p>“Other regiments suffered terribly from lice, but so far as I know we
had none in the Royal Irish. I certainly had none in my company.
I attribute this to the fact that our men were always in the water to
shove the boat off if she stuck on a sandbank or rock, while I noticed
other regiments seemed to dislike getting into the water, and used to
try to shove off a boat that stuck with poles and oars, and much bad
language. The day’s work did not vary much: we awoke at the first
streak of dawn&mdash;had some tea or coffee and biscuit&mdash;bully beef if you
cared for it, and then used to sail if the wind was really strong&mdash;which
to us seemed very seldom,&mdash;to sail and row, if the wind was only
moderate. If there was no wind, or an adverse one, it was a case of
rowing, or towing if the bank was favourable, the latter being a quicker
mode of progression than rowing against the strong current. If we had
a really good sailing breeze, we didn’t like to waste it, and had cold bully
beef and biscuit at about midday as we sailed along, but if we had had a
tough morning’s row or two, we used to halt for about an hour to have a
hot meal. At about sunset the leading boat of the company would halt
for the night at some suitable spot, and the others if possible closed up.
This often was not possible, owing to the numerous mishaps that were
always taking place from bumps on rocks and sandbanks. The boats,
when the Royal Irish took them over, had done several trips already,
and were for the most part in a pretty rotten condition, and the materials
for repairing them had run out, so that we had to use any expedients
such as biscuit tins, &amp;c., to patch them up. I thought myself lucky if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
on arrival at the night halting-place there was no damaged boat to
mend, and that in consequence I could get a full night’s sleep&mdash;such a
splendid sleep it was, too, under the clear sky of the Soudan winter!
The ordinary monotony of the journey was broken at places like Dal,
where one had to pull for four solid hours up a gigantic mill-stream,
sometimes only gaining a few feet after half an hour’s pull, when one’s
muscles felt as if they would crack. At Dal we took out the rifles
and ammunition and a few of the boxes out of each boat, took a picked
crew of eight men, and had two half-breed Indians in the boat, one at
the helm, the other in the bows with a pole. It was most exciting
work, and at first the task looked an impossible one, but the skill with
which the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voyageurs</i> took advantage of every back water, and shot past
the most dangerous-looking places was perfectly marvellous. Most of
us officers learnt the trick before we reached Korti, and could have
qualified as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voyageurs</i>. Amongst the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voyageurs</i> I should tell you, there
were some who had not much claim to the title, and hardly knew the
stern of a boat from the bow. They had come out for a picnic, but
when they saw the Cataracts they ‘went sick’! One of the so-called
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voyageurs</i> was a man who had been in the Royal Irish a short time
before we went to Egypt. He was a smart, plucky fellow, who soon
learnt the tricks of the trade, and by the time the regiment came up he
was quite an expert, and went by the name of ‘Dare-Devil Dick.’ Some
of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voyageurs</i> were an insubordinate lot, and gave a good deal of
trouble&mdash;especially in wanting to halt, and as they were not subject to
military law it was difficult to know what to do with them on these
occasions. One gentleman, however, met his match, after he had been
particularly abusive to an officer who was well known in the service
for his handiness with his fists. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voyageur</i>, amongst other things,
said that he was not going to obey any one’s orders, and that he was as
good a man as any officer, so the officer told his men to row ashore,
which they did; he then took off his coat and said, ‘You said you were
as good a man as I am, take off your coat and I’ll show you whether you
are or not.’ The Canadian looked at him for a moment, and then said,
quite quietly, ‘No, boss, I guess not.’ ‘All right,’ said the officer, ‘you
will obey my orders in future, or out of the boat you go, neck and crop.’
After that there was no further trouble.</p>

<p>“Pipes, or rather a lack of pipes, were soon a matter of great difficulty.
The old soldier had not acquired the modern habit of cigarette
smoking, and clay pipes were practically the only kind the men ever
smoked. In the rough work of the Nile boat the supply of these
soon gave out, and in my boat after about a week there was only
one stump of a ‘dhudheen’ left amongst the twelve of us. This was
passed round, each man getting ‘two or three draws and a spit’ out
of it. I had started with three or four briar pipes, but they all disappeared&mdash;appropriated,
I regret to say, by officers. As I did not care
to share the dirty little stump that did duty for a pipe in my boat,
I had to devise something as a substitute for my beloved briars. A
broken oar-handle for the bowl, a boat’s auger, and a hollow reed for
the stem soon provided me with the means of making quite a serviceable
article. As the ash of the oar got very charred, the bowl had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
to be lined with a bit of biscuit tin. My patent was soon copied, and
in a few days, as far as my crew was concerned, it was a case of
‘one man one pipe.’ My pipe did me yeoman’s service till after the
return of the battalion from Metemmeh, when, amongst other luxuries
in the shape of jam and sardines, an enterprising Greek brought up
a store of wooden pipes which he sold at fabulous prices.”</p></div>

<p>The only amusement on the voyage was to watch the wild geese and
pelicans which abounded in some parts of the river, to look for traces of
the hippopotami, much disturbed by the long procession of whale-boats
through the upper part of the river, and to take “pot-shots” at the crocodiles.
The old ones were wary, and offered but indifferent targets for the officers’
revolvers; the young ones, less used to the ways of mankind, were slower
in taking to the water. One, indeed, remained so long on an overhanging
bank that when a party of the Royal Irish approached him his only means
of escape was by taking a header into the water, right over a man who
was standing on the edge of the river.</p>

<p>On the 23rd of January the leading boats reached Korti, where by the
27th the whole regiment was assembled, but not in the same strength as
it left Cairo. The hardships and fatigues of the unaccustomed life had
taken toll, and many men had been dropped at various hospitals on the
line of communication.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> One soldier had been drowned in the Nile,
a fate which Lieutenant-Colonel Hugh Shaw, V.C., nearly shared. His boat
was working close in-shore when a sudden fall of earth and stones from
the bank struck her gunwale, and threw him into the swiftly running
river. As soon as the dust had cleared away he was seen struggling in
the stream; instantly Orderly-Room Sergeant Hanrahan and Colour-Sergeant
Moylan plunged into the water, swam to him, and held him up until all
three were rescued. For this gallant action the bronze medals of the
Royal Humane Society were awarded to these non-commissioned officers.
The Royal Irish won great praise not only for the short time in which
they made the passage from Sarras, but also for the excellent care they
had taken of the stores with which their boats were freighted, and Lord
Wolseley’s thanks were officially conveyed to them in a special general
order dated the 4th of February, 1885.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The following battalions in the order given have completed the
journey from Sarras to Debbeh in the quickest time:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent pad6">
1. The 1st Battalion Royal Irish.<br />
2. The 1st Battalion Gordon Highlanders.<br />
3. The 1st Battalion Royal West Kent.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">The 2nd Division Naval Brigade, the Royal Irish, and the Royal West
Kent have distinguished themselves by the care they have taken of
their boats. The division of the Naval Brigade and Captain Forster’s
Company of the Royal Irish handed in their supplies at Korti complete,
no case or package being either damaged or missing. General
Lord Wolseley congratulates the men of the Royal Irish most heartily
upon having won the small prize which he offered to mark his personal
appreciation of the battalion which should accomplish the difficult
journey of about 370 miles in the shortest time. As they have been
first on the river, so he hopes they may be amongst the first to enter
Khartoum, and he feels assured that he can wish this old and distinguished
regiment nothing more thoroughly in accordance with its own
desires.</p>

<p>“It has been most gratifying to watch the manner in which all the
battalions have striven to reach at the earliest date this point where the
army was to concentrate, and Lord Wolseley warmly thanks both officers
and soldiers for the untiring spirit shown by them in overcoming the
many and serious obstacles to navigation presented by the cataracts
and rapids of the great river. All alike have worked well and cheerfully
under conditions entailing considerable privation and continuous labour.</p>

<p>“The conduct of all ranks has been most creditable to the army,
and Lord Wolseley will not fail to bring the energy and discipline
that have been shown to the notice of Her Majesty the Queen.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="padr2 smcap">“Evelyn Wood,</span><br />

<p>In forwarding his cheque for £100 Lord Wolseley wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

“<span class="smcap">Camp Korti, The Soudan</span>,<br />

you the enclosed cheque for £100, the prize won by your splendid
Battalion by having come up the Nile to Debbeh in boats in less time

to feel that my small prize has been carried off by my own countrymen.&mdash;Believe
me to be, dear Col. Shaw, very truly yours, <span class="smcap">Wolseley</span>.”</p></div>

<p>The general situation, as far as it was known when the XVIIIth reached
Korti, was very gloomy. Khartoum was besieged on three sides, and on
Gordon now rested the entire burden of its defence. In August he had
sent his only fellow-countrymen, Lieutenant-Colonel D. Stewart and Mr
Power, the correspondent of ‘The Times,’ on a mission down the river;
their steamer had been wrecked, and they had been treacherously murdered
by Arabs who had offered them hospitality. Thus with no officer whom
he could trust, no friend in whom he could confide, he was left alone to
face the hordes of fanatics by whom he was surrounded, while his men
were suffering much from physical privations, and from the mental depression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
produced by waiting in vain for the British troops who, as their General
had repeatedly assured them, were coming to their help. The tone of
Gordon’s latest messages, brought by native runners to Lord Wolseley,
showed that his position was growing so desperate that the time for which
Khartoum could hold out must no longer be reckoned in months and weeks,
but in days and hours. A modification of the plan of campaign had therefore
become necessary. In the original scheme the point for the second concentration
of the relieving force was fixed at Shendi, a town on the right
bank of the Nile, faced on the opposite shore by the villages of Metemmeh
and Gubat. But the passage of a column of boats over the four hundred
miles of river between Korti and Shendi would inevitably take several weeks.
Hitherto the troops had only been called upon to overcome natural difficulties:
now they would be in the enemy’s country, and while working up
rapids at least as troublesome as those already ascended, they would be
exposed at any moment to attack and consequent delay. Even if unmolested
on the lower reaches, they were committed to one serious military operation,
the capture of Berber, a town on the Nile a hundred miles below
Shendi; it commanded the river, and therefore must be seized and occupied
before the expedition could pass it on the voyage up stream. From these
various causes the column must necessarily move so slowly that long before
the first whaler could be expected to appear off Shendi, Gordon might be
overwhelmed, yet the Nile was the only route by which a large body of
troops with adequate supplies could be placed within striking distance of
Khartoum. For smaller detachments, however, the river was not the only
possible line of advance. A glance at the map will show that the Nile in its
windings between Shendi and Korti forms two sides of a huge triangle, the
third side of which is marked by the camel track, 173 miles in length,
linking Korti with Metemmeh. This road crosses the Bayuda desert, a
barren waste of sand, dotted at rare intervals with wells for the most
part inadequate for the needs of any considerable number of animals and
men&mdash;yet in a dash across this desert lay the only hope of saving Gordon.</p>

<p>Lord Wolseley determined to divide the force which remained available
for active operations after the safety of his line of communication had been
secured. To Major-General Earle he entrusted the “river column,” a strong
brigade of all arms, which, after capturing Berber, was to establish an advanced
base near Shendi. The camel corps and various other troops were
placed under the orders of Brigadier-General Sir Herbert Stewart, who
was to lead the “desert column” across country to Metemmeh, and there
establish an advanced base. If the information he received there convinced
him that Khartoum was at the last gasp, he was to push forward at once with
the “camelry” to Gordon’s rescue, but if the danger did not seem immediate he
was to stand fast, and co-operate with Earle when the river column had won<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
its way to Shendi. If Stewart halted at Metemmeh, his Intelligence officer,
Colonel Sir Charles Wilson, was to embark with a few picked men on the
Egyptian steamers which were known to be waiting on that part of the
Nile to establish touch with the British, push on towards Khartoum, and,
if possible, communicate with Gordon.</p>

<p>Though Lord Wolseley was intensely anxious to place Stewart’s column
within reach of Gordon, it was not until the end of December that the
preparations for the movement were completed. Among the innumerable
difficulties which confronted the commander of the expedition two stood
out pre-eminently. One was the probability, almost the certainty, that at
Metemmeh the desert column would find neither food for themselves nor
forage for their camels, and that a large amount of bulky supplies must
therefore accompany the troops. The other was the fact that, although
camels were the only means by which stores could be carried across the
desert, the number of these animals at his disposal was inadequate, and
could not be supplemented from local sources, as the Mudir of Dongola
had failed in his promise to obtain a large quantity of them from his
tribesmen. As enough camels could not be collected to carry to Metemmeh in
one trip the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">personnel</i> and supplies of the column, Wolseley decided to cross
the Bayuda desert by stages. To carry out this plan it was necessary, as a
first measure, to form a depôt between Korti and Metemmeh; and Gakdul,<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> 98
miles from Korti, was selected, as it was known that its two or three natural
reservoirs yielded a good supply of drinking water. In addition to the
stores which were to be left at Gakdul, and the supplies for the march there
and back, the camels had to carry not only their own food, for the desert
yielded but scanty grazing, but also water for the whole column, as it was
known that the wells between Korti and Gakdul could not be depended
upon. As the XVIIIth a month later followed the track of this convoy,
the details of the march of Stewart’s “camelry” will show how remarkable
were the performances of the first battalion, when it crossed the desert on
foot. At 3 <span class="fs70">P.M.</span> on December 30, 1884, the first convoy of 2206 camels
started, with an escort of about 1100 troops, the mounted infantry on
camels, the XIXth Hussars on their horses. With an interval of two
hours the column marched till 7.30 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span> on the 31st, rested for eight
hours, then pushed on again, stopping at 8 <span class="fs70">P.M.</span> for a short time at the
wells of Hambok, where a small quantity of very indifferent water was
obtained, and halted at 1.15 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span> on January 1, 1885, at the well of
El Howeiya, which yielded no better water than that of Hambok. At
8.30 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span> the convoy was again in motion, and plodded on till 1 <span class="fs70">P.M.</span>, rested
for two hours and a half, and then pushed on throughout the night and
early morning until at 6.45 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span> on the 2nd it reached Gakdul, where there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
proved to be abundance of good water. The ninety-eight miles from
Korti had been covered in 63¾ hours, 32¾ hours of which had been spent
in actual marching; but weary as the troops were, no rest could be allowed
them. The stores with which the camels were loaded had to be unpacked
and arranged in proper order; the camels to be watered&mdash;a process which
occupied the whole day, and the post to be prepared for defence, for though
from the absence of formed bodies of the enemy it was clear that the march
across the desert had taken the Mahdists by surprise, their scouts had been
seen hovering in the distance.</p>

<p>Before the next stage in the advance to Metemmeh could be undertaken
the intermediate base had to be completely filled up with supplies, and to
bring these, Stewart started on the return journey to Korti less than fourteen
hours after he had reached Gakdul. He left behind him a garrison of
422 officers and men to guard the wells, and improve the arrangements for
watering the troops and the camels; and he dropped small parties at the
minor water-holes to clean them to the best of their ability. By noon on
the 5th Stewart was back at Korti; but though his men had not suffered
from their exertions, his camels had felt the strain. Tired by their long
march up the Nile, the animals were in poor condition when they left Korti;
they had been on short rations of food and water on the journey to and
from Gakdul, and though every effort had been made to bring more camels
from lower Egypt, the supply of fresh animals was quite inadequate, and
the rest of the work in the desert had to be done by beasts whose strength
and endurance was rapidly diminishing. On the 7th a second convoy of
1000 camels left Korti: 100 were laden with small-arm ammunition, 80 with
medical stores, 30 with artillery stores, the remainder with food supplies.
This column reached Gakdul in safety, and on its return passed Stewart,
who on the 8th marched from Korti with 1600 troops, about 300 natives
(chiefly camel-drivers from Aden), 2228 camels, and 155 horses.</p>

<p>The second phase of the desert march began on January 14, when
Stewart pushed southwards from Gakdul with 1802 officers and men, three
light pieces of artillery and a “Gardner” gun, 155 horses belonging to the
XIXth Hussars, 1700 riding and 1188 transport camels. Two days later the
XIXth Hussars came into contact with the enemy near the wells of Abu
Klea, where on the 17th the Mahdists, after a very desperate fight, were
defeated with a loss of about a thousand killed. Our casualties were
9 officers and 65 other ranks killed, 9 officers and 85 other ranks wounded.
Struggling onwards towards Metemmeh, the desert column again met the
enemy on the 19th, this time at Abu Kru, close to the river. The Arabs
fought with as much gallantry as at Abu Klea, but were again heavily
defeated, and fled leaving the ground covered with their dead. To us the
cost of this engagement was 1 officer and 22 other ranks killed, 8 officers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
and 90 other ranks wounded; among the latter was Sir Herbert Stewart,
who eventually succumbed to his injuries. When he fell, Colonel Sir
Charles Wilson succeeded to the command of the troops, though Captain
Lord Charles Beresford, R.N., in charge of the small Naval contingent
which accompanied the column, was actually the senior officer present.</p>

<p>On the 20th, Wilson occupied the village of Gubat, which is within
half a mile of the river; next day he threatened Metemmeh, two miles
farther inland, but before his attack had developed several Egyptian
steamers came in sight, and some hundreds of Gordon’s Soudanese soldiers
landed, bringing the news that a considerable body of Mahdists were advancing.
Wilson recalled his troops; fortified himself at Gubat; reconnoitred
in various directions, and after many delays owing to the worn-out
machinery of the river-boats, embarked on the 24th with a handful of the
Royal Sussex and a considerable number of the Soudanese on his mission
to Khartoum. It was not until this date that he was able to send off a
despatch to Lord Wolseley describing the battle of the 19th and the movements
which followed it. This report reached Korti in the early morning
of January 28, and Wolseley at once decided to send Sir Redvers Buller to
take command of the desert column, and to reinforce it with infantry, who
were not to be carried on camels but to march on foot. Mindful of
his promise that the battalion which won his prize on the river should
have every opportunity of distinguishing itself on land, Lord Wolseley
selected the Royal Irish to accompany Sir Redvers, and ordered them to
move in detachments, the headquarters with A, B, and C companies starting
that evening, the remainder following as soon as possible. In the afternoon
of January 28, 1885, the battalion paraded for Lord Wolseley’s inspection,
dressed in the fighting kit devised for them by a former commanding officer,
Colonel M. J. R. MacGregor. It consisted of a khaki-coloured frock and
trousers of cotton drill, a helmet covered with the same material, grey
woollen putties, a woollen shirt, socks, and ammunition boots; spine protectors,
cholera belts, and drawers had been issued, but were not in general use
among the rank and file; all hands carried haversacks, wooden water-bottles,
and rolled greatcoats. The officers wore “Sam Browne” belts, which
supported their swords and field-glasses, revolvers and cartridge-pouches;
the non-commissioned officers and men were equipped with braces and waistbelts,
pouches containing seventy rounds of ammunition, three-edged
bayonets (longer than those in use at the present day), and Martini-Henry
rifles. As in previous campaigns it had been discovered that
when these rifles were fired fast, the barrels became so hot that it was
almost impossible to grasp them, they were fitted with leather hand-guards,
tightly laced round the stock and barrel behind the back-sight, to enable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
the men to get a firm grip of their weapons. The remainder of the campaigning
kit was carried on transport camels; to every ten men was allotted
one animal, which was loaded with their camp kettles, a blanket and a
waterproof sheet apiece, and one or two sea-kit bags, each of which contained
sets of the following articles, viz.: one flannel shirt, two pairs of socks, a tin of
grease, a canteen, a towel, soap, and a hold-all, complete. The troops were
allowed no tents.</p>

<p>When Lord Wolseley rode on to the parade ground he was saluted
by as fine a body of soldiers as he had ever seen. By a process of natural
selection the weakly men had been weeded out in the voyage up the
river, and only those of perfect constitution had reached Korti. Thanks
to the varied forms of exercise they had taken since they left Cairo, the
soldiers drawn up before him were in rude health and fit to go anywhere
and do anything. After he had warmly praised their appearance, which
he described as “hard, lean, and long-legged,” and informed them that to
the regiment would probably be awarded the prize for the race from Sarras
to Debbeh, he warned the Royal Irish that very hard work awaited them
in the Bayuda desert. Before they could reach Gakdul they would have
to make six marches, each sixteen miles long, in a country so dry that
they must not count on receiving more than half a gallon of water a-day,
a ration which they must make do for drinking, cooking, and washing!
He wound up his speech by telling the XVIIIth that he trusted soon to
join it on the other side of the desert, a hope, however, doomed to be
frustrated by specific orders from home desiring him to remain at Korti,
the better to direct the movements both of the desert and the river columns,
the latter of which had been set in motion on the 24th of January.</p>

<p>When the inspection was over the headquarter companies returned to
their preparations for the march. The skins containing water for the
journey were filled, rations drawn, camels taken down to the river to
drink and then loaded, and just after nightfall on January 28, 1885, the
column started&mdash;as all ranks hoped and believed for Khartoum. The
first two or three stages of the journey across the desert were by no
means agreeable. The men of the XVIIIth had not only to look after
their own regimental camels and those of the large convoy they were
escorting to Gakdul, but to watch over the safety of a number of slaughter
cattle and to prevent the camel-drivers from tapping the water-skins, which
were not to be opened unless by order of high authority. Though the
Royal Irish had mastered the ways of a whale-boat in the rapids, they
were new to the tricks of the camel-drivers, who, from idleness or dishonesty,
often fastened the loads so insecurely that in the night everything
slipped off the saddles and fell in a cascade upon the sand. The soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
had to pick up the boxes of stores and baggage which littered the desert
and re-pack them firmly; they had also to halt frequently to enable weakly
or lazy animals to keep up in their proper places; but when, after two
or three rude experiences, they had learned how to cope with the camels
and the natives who drove them, these initial difficulties were overcome
and the troops pushed sturdily on towards Gakdul. For the greater part
of the way the track ran over great plains of yellow sand, which played
havoc with the men’s boots, already partly worn out by the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">portages</i> on
the Nile; but occasionally it crossed low round-topped ridges of black
rock, belts of coarse dark-green grass, and thick growths of low acacia
and mimosa trees. As the column marched at night and rested by day,
the officers were able to get some sport; a gazelle was bagged and many
sand-grouse were seen, though not hit, for the Martini-Henry rifle hardly
lends itself to shooting birds on the wing! The rations consisted of a pound
of ship’s biscuit and the same amount of preserved salt beef, an ounce of
tea and three of sugar, an ounce of preserved vegetables, a quarter of an
ounce of salt, and 1/320 of a gallon of lime juice. The thirst produced by
the combined effect of the salt beef and the dry heat of the desert was
great, and the regular allowance of half a gallon of water was hardly sufficient
to quench it. General Forster’s diary records the joy with which
all hands greeted the occasional issue of a larger supply; an additional
quart rendered it possible to do a little cooking, while an extra half gallon
brought some form of washing within the range of practical politics! On
the half gallon issue the men could only spare enough water to make tea;
as their salt beef had been well cooked before it was hermetically sealed
in tin, they ate it cold; if water enough could be obtained, the preserved
vegetables were soaked and boiled in the lid of a canteen.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> To rest the
camels, now breaking down fast from the combined effects of too much
work and too little food and water, the convoy halted at the wells of El
Howeyat for twenty-four hours and then marched on to Gakdul. The
headquarters of the Royal Irish reached this post early on the 4th of
February, and next day were joined by four more companies (D, E, F,
and G) of the battalion under Lieutenant-Colonel Wray. Unencumbered
by the charge of a large convoy, this detachment had covered the ninety-eight
miles between Korti and Gakdul in a hundred and eight hours&mdash;a
very fine performance for men who, though in perfect all-round training,
had done no marching for many weeks.</p>

<p>The journey across the desert had so far been uneventful. The only
exciting incident was the escapade of a lance-corporal, who temporarily
losing his reason, wandered into the desert, and was not rescued till he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
had strayed twelve miles from the bivouac. A few tribesmen, captured
by the irregulars who guarded the lines of communication, were the only
enemies seen; they were wild-looking savages, short but wiry, with fierce
eyes gleaming under shocks of matted hair, and armed with formidable
spears more than five feet in length. They did not form part of the
Mahdi’s regular army, but were local freebooters, more disposed to
plunder than to fight. When the Royal Irish were a few miles north
of Gakdul they met messengers hurrying to Korti with the news that
Khartoum had fallen. On the 5th they had comparative rest, but on the
6th they were kept hard at work filling water-skins at the wells, ready
for the next stage in their advance&mdash;Gakdul to Abu Klea, a distance of
fifty-two miles. While thus employed they were joined by H company,
which had been detained at Korti when the second detachment moved
forward. In their anxiety to lose no chance of distinguishing themselves
the company had made a great march, winding up by covering twenty-eight
miles on the last day. Sir Redvers Buller, who had ridden part of
the way from Korti with the headquarter companies, did not allow H
company to start with the rest of the battalion when it marched on the
7th, but, mounting them on camels, sent them on a day or two later. How
the men liked this new form of locomotion is not recorded, but it is probable
that many agreed with the sailor who, after his first ride, remarked,
“My camel is a queer beast. He’s been playing cup and ball with me all
the afternoon and only missed me twice!”</p>

<p>Hitherto only the precautions usual in ordinary warfare had been taken
on the march and in the bivouac, but now that the Royal Irish were well
in the enemy’s country and liable to attack at any moment, the formation
was adopted which recent experience had proved to be best suited for fighting
in the Soudan. Under the immediate escort of one company, successive
lines of camels, about forty abreast, lumbered along in a loose column
which, if necessary, could be closed up into a solid mass. At one of the
front angles of the column of camels were four companies; at the opposite
rear angle was the remainder of the battalion, both marching in column
or half-column of companies, ready to form square at a moment’s notice.
The animals laden with the reserve of ammunition moved behind the leading
companies into whose square they were to be received in case of danger;
those bearing the rations and the water-skins followed the companies in
rear, who were charged with their defence. If the enemy attacked, each
square could support the other with flanking fire, and both could rake
the ground over which spearmen would have to pass in order to close on
the camels with the cold steel. At every halt square was formed, and at
night the bivouacs were surrounded with <em>zaribas</em>&mdash;walls of stone, boxes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
stores, saddles or mimosa bushes, anything, in short, which would serve
to break a sudden rush of the Mahdi’s followers.</p>

<p>The column, however, was not attacked, and notwithstanding the cumbrous
formation in which the Royal Irish moved they got over the ground fast,
and on one occasion marched twenty-four miles in twenty-five hours and
a quarter, coming in fairly fresh, alert, and fit for outpost duty. They
reached Abu Klea on the morning of the 12th, passing close to the battlefield
of January 17, still covered with dead bodies, for though the Mahdists
had buried their chiefs, the rank and file remained where they had fallen.
Two companies, C and E, were dropped at the wells to strengthen the
garrison of the post; the remainder of the battalion, after a few hours’ rest,
started for Gubat, where they arrived next day after a march of twenty-one
miles, “swinging into bivouac,” as Sir Redvers Buller reported, “as
cheerily as if they had been going to a field-day at Aldershot.” The troops
of the desert column received the XVIIIth with great enthusiasm, turning
out to a man to cheer it into camp. Among them were the soldiers who
had accompanied Wilson in his abortive attempt to rescue Gordon from
Khartoum, and who had just struggled back to Gubat after a series of
adventures, remarkable even in the annals of the British army. In two
tiny steamers, manned by natives of very doubtful loyalty, they had
laboriously passed through the long and dangerous series of rapids known
as the Sixth Cataract, and after running the gauntlet of the enemy’s guns
and rifles, had arrived off Khartoum&mdash;to find that barely thirty-six hours
earlier the town had been captured by the Mahdi, into whose hands Gordon,
if he was still alive, had undoubtedly fallen. Wilson realised that his
mission had failed, and with a heavy heart ordered his steamers to retire
down the river. The retreat was conducted in circumstances as unpropitious
as can be imagined; the native crews, excited at the defeat of the
Christian General, were almost mutinous; the Soudanese, by far the majority
of the fighting men on board, were stupefied by the knowledge that their
wives and children were in the Mahdi’s clutches; every hour the dangers
of navigation increased, for the Nile was sinking fast, and in one night
dropped no less than three feet. But in spite of all difficulties Wilson
made good progress down stream until his steamers, one after the other,
were wrecked by the treachery of the Arab pilots. Landing his troops
on an island he entrenched himself, and succeeded in informing the British
at Gubat of his desperate plight. The sailors at once manned one of the
river boats and fought their way up the Nile in time to save Wilson
and his comrades from the destruction which threatened to overwhelm
them.</p>

<p>On his way to Gubat, Buller had received a despatch from Lord Wolseley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
written after the news of the fall of Khartoum had reached headquarters, but
before the rescue of Wilson’s detachment had been reported at Korti. His
orders were to ensure the safety of Wilson and his men; to send all sick
and wounded back to Korti; to make every preparation for the evacuation
of Gubat, and if he considered it necessary, to fall back to Abu Klea or even
to Gakdul. When Buller reached Gubat the situation was full of difficulty.
Wilson indeed was safe, but within two miles of the bivouac was the strongly
built village of Metemmeh, which we had threatened but not seriously
attacked. It was held by two thousand of the enemy, almost delirious with
joy at their victory at Khartoum; the Intelligence officers had ascertained
that three or four thousand Mahdists, well provided with rifles, guns, and
ammunition would shortly reinforce Metemmeh, and as there was nothing
now to detain the Mahdi before Khartoum, his main army might also have
to be reckoned with. The supplies of the desert column were running
short: at Gubat there were only rations for twelve days, and the depôt at
Abu Klea contained but a similar quantity. Worse than all, the transport
was breaking down rapidly; “the camels,” Buller reported, “are emaciated,
and their carrying power small. Indeed I do not think we have camels
enough to get this force out at one go.” After a few hours’ deliberation
he reluctantly decided to retire, and began his preparations, fortunately unhindered
by the enemy who circled round the bivouac without attempting
to close in upon it. Early on the morning of the 13th of February the
sick and wounded were sent off, the convalescents on camels, the worst cases
on stretchers carried by Gordon’s Soudanese. The convoy was escorted by
part of the camel corps and three companies of the Royal Irish, and when
all danger of an attack seemed over, the detachment was ordered to rejoin
the main body of the battalion. Just as the three companies reached the
bivouac a Hussar orderly dashed into the lines to report that eight or nine
miles off the convoy was surrounded by a large number of the enemy,
and was in great peril. Colonel Shaw and half a battalion of the XVIIIth
hurried off to the rescue, but to their deep disgust did not come into action.
The Mahdists had surrounded the convoy on three sides and were pouring
in a fairly well directed fire when a detachment of camelry, on the way from
Abu Klea to Gubat, suddenly struck the enemy on the flank just as the Royal
Irish began to come in sight. The Arabs did not await Shaw’s attack and
retired, leaving the convoy free to go on to Abu Klea, which it reached without
further incident. Shaw’s half battalion did not accompany the sick, but was
ordered back to Gubat, where the troops spent the night in destroying stores
which could not be carried away and throwing into the Nile boxes of ammunition
for which there was no transport. As day broke on the 14th, the column,
1700 strong, was set in motion. With the exception of a few of the XIXth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
Hussars whose horses were still serviceable, all arms and all ranks trudged
over the desert on foot. The post of honour, the command of the rear-guard,
was entrusted to Colonel Shaw, who covered the retreat with the Royal Irish,
two guns, a detachment of the XIXth Hussars, and three hundred of Gordon’s
Soudanese. A few of the enemy followed, but when Buller halted and offered
battle the Mahdists drew off, and by midday on the 15th the column was
in bivouac at Abu Klea. The men had not suffered much on the march,
though the boots were beginning to fall off their feet, but so many animals
had dropped from exhaustion that General Buller was forced to admit that
any active operations were entirely out of the question, until the mounted
corps were supplied with fresh camels, the transport camels replaced, and
the XIXth Hussars completely remounted. There was not forage enough
for the surviving animals, and it was evident that the wells could not be
relied upon to supply the whole of the troops now concentrated around them.
Buller accordingly decided to send back to Gakdul most of the camelry, all
spare camels, and nearly all the XIXth Hussars, while with the remainder
of his command he awaited instructions at Abu Klea.</p>

<p>The two companies of the XVIIIth detached to garrison the post of Abu
Klea now rejoined headquarters, bringing with them a record of excellent
service performed in clearing the bush which surrounded the wells, building
<em>zaribas</em>, and similar useful though unshowy work. Early on the 16th, the
battalion was directed to entrench one of the low hills which encircle the
wells; just as the shelter trenches were finished and occupied, and the men
were eating a well-earned meal, large numbers of the enemy appeared on
ground commanding the defences of the Royal Irish, and opened fire at
about 1100 yards’ range. To meet this attack, which enfiladed some of the
trenches, fresh works had to be thrown up under continuous and sometimes
very heavy musketry. “The Gardner and the screw-guns gave the enemy
a little physic,” wrote an officer in his diary, “but the rebels kept it up
all night, and we expected an attack at any time. Next morning they began
in a desultory sort of way, but a few shells and a strong infantry fire made
them lie close. Finally a field-piece of theirs came into action, but its
shells fell short and dead. Two of our 7-pounders went out and fired a
round or two, and the Mahdists then disappeared. We had an easy night
on the 17th, and only regretted two things: one that we had not had a slap
at them, the other that we had not received the half pound of bread that
was due to us as a ration!” During this prolonged skirmish, in which there
were many “close shaves” from the flat-trajectoried Remington rifles used
by the enemy, Quartermaster and Honorary Lieutenant Jamieson and
thirteen other ranks were wounded.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> In the column the total casualties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
were three men killed, four officers and twenty-three other ranks wounded.
For the next few days the regiment was very busy cutting down scrub and
building redoubts&mdash;work with which the enemy’s fire did not materially
interfere, as it was delivered from a very respectful distance.</p>

<p>When the untoward news of the fall of Khartoum reached England, the
country was profoundly moved. A great cry for vengeance arose, and amidst
a whirlwind of telegrams from the Cabinet, Lord Wolseley recast his plans,
and proposed that the towns of Abu Hamed and Berber should be captured,
and held during the summer as posts to cover an advance in strength up
the river in the cool season. Government accepted the idea, and sent an
expedition to Suakim to draw off to the shores of the Red Sea part of the
enemy who might otherwise attack the troops echeloned along the Nile. But
by the middle of February it become evident that Wolseley’s scheme was
too ambitious. The river column, though successful in an engagement at
Kirbekan, was making slow progress up stream owing to the abnormally
“low Nile.” To enable this column to arrive at Berber with its cargo of
stores intact, the original plan had provided that it should be fed by convoys
across the desert of Korosko, but recent events at Khartoum had roused the
fanaticism of the tribesmen to such an extent that it was very improbable
this route would long remain open. A large quantity of Earle’s biscuit had
proved uneatable; the remainder would only carry the column to Berber
and back to Korti, and therefore none could be left to ration the garrison
of Berber when that place had been taken. Wolseley thereupon proposed
that the Royal Irish and part of the camel corps should strike across the
Bayuda desert and fall upon Berber from the westward, but he was forced
to abandon this idea when he realised that the transport, without which it
was impossible to undertake the expedition to Berber, had completely given
out, and that the marching power of the troops was seriously crippled by the
condition of their boots.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In view of all these conditions the Commander-in-Chief felt that he
was no longer justified in persevering with the combined movement of the
Desert and River columns on Berber, and he was forced, reluctantly, to
abandon all hope of taking that place before the autumn. The intention
to take Berber being given up, the capture of Abu Hamed became unnecessary;
it would only have led to a useless waste of life, and have unnecessarily
prolonged the line of river to be defended during the summer
months. The retention of the Desert column in its exposed position in
the desert was equally without object. A concentration on the Nile
became the only course open to Lord Wolseley. Orders were accordingly
sent on the 20th February, directing the river column to return ... and
at the same time Sir Redvers Buller was directed to return to Korti.”<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>In obedience to this order the one thousand seven hundred and forty
effectives,<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> left to General Buller, made ready to march on the evening of
the 23rd of February after an exciting day. About 11 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span> Captain
Morgan, Royal Irish Regiment, from his outpost to the south-east of the
bivouac had signalled that masses of the enemy were advancing towards
Abu Klea. Later it was reported that the Mahdists, between five and
eight thousand strong, had halted two or three miles from the wells. The
situation was a serious one, but neither the General nor his men were disturbed
at the news: the packing was carefully finished, the convoy of
wounded sent off under a strong escort, the wells filled up with thorny
scrub and the many saddles for which there were no camels left, and soon
after sunset the troops filed away in good order, leaving the Royal Irish to
bring up the rear. The camp fires were made up, the usual bugle calls were
sounded, and then in groups of twos and threes the men of the XVIIIth
silently collected at the appointed place and were formed into a rear-guard.
Whether the evacuation of the wells was unnoticed by the enemy, or whether
the Mahdists thought it wiser not to attack the retiring column, is not
known, but the fact remains that Buller was not seriously molested in his
retreat, of which Major-General Burton Forster’s diary gives interesting
details. “During the night of the 23rd-24th many camels fell down and
were left behind. Halts were numerous, and we had a very hard and
awkward march in the dim moonlight through the grass and scrub till
11.30 <span class="fs70">P.M.</span> The <em>rouse</em> sounded at 4 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span> (24th) and we started at 5, having
come about 9 miles from Abu Klea. We marched till about 9.30, seeing
only a few of the enemy’s scouts in the afternoon, and halted about 18 miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
from Abu Klea. The vedettes fired at them and they disappeared. We
started again at 5 <span class="fs70">P.M.</span>, and marched on till midnight, rested on the 25th
till 5 <span class="fs70">P.M.</span>, when we started again, halting at 9.30 <span class="fs70">P.M.</span> after doing 13 miles.
Next morning we started at 6 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span> and reached Gakdul about noon....
The work has been stiff and hot, especially on a daily ration of three-quarters
of a gallon of water!... I think the march of 56 miles in 64 hours is very
creditable to Buller’s column.... The men have been in their clothes
without changing or washing from the 16th to the 26th, and it has told
on them: they are not as fit about the feet as we could wish. Some of
the officers succeeded in changing their socks once during the ten days, and
were more comfortable in consequence.”</p>

<p>An interesting account of the retreat is given in a letter written from
Gakdul on February 27, 1885, by Colonel B. J. C. Doran, C.B., then a
subaltern in the first battalion, Royal Irish regiment.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You will see by the address that we have commenced retracing our
steps towards Korti, we arrived here yesterday morning and very
thankful we all were to get in. The march back has been so far
anything but comfortable, and our march going up was child’s play
compared with this retreat, for of course then the regiment was by itself
in two detachments and could consequently move pretty quickly having
only a small amount of transport to hamper it, but marching with the
‘Desert Column’ as it is called, is quite another thing, besides having a
large Hospital of sick and wounded to take care of. We left Abu Klea
on the 23rd in two parties; the first consisting of the Hospitals and the
whole of the baggage, rations, &amp;c., for the column escorted by some
mounted infantry started at 2 <span class="fs70">P.M.</span> I went with this lot, as I am acting
Quartermaster now to the regiment. The second party consisted of all
the troops and did not start till 7 <span class="fs70">P.M.</span>: they had no baggage or transport
to hinder them, so of course when they started were able to catch us up,
as they did about 8 or 9 miles out of Abu Klea where we halted and
where a depôt of water had been left; they got in about 1 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span> We
started off again at daylight and marched till about 10 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span>, when the
whole column halted, pretty well done up; the water question all along
has been a very difficult affair. We were to rest here until 4 <span class="fs70">P.M.</span>, when
we were again to start off, however just as everyone had made themselves
as comfortable as is possible on these occasions under a blanket to
keep off the sun and were just getting a few winks of sleep, we were
startled at hearing heavy firing going on in our rear; it was at some
distance but the sound of cannon being fired was quite distinct, everyone
was up like a shot, and orders were given to get all baggage loaded
ready to move off at once. However, after half an hour’s excitement we
desisted, as it was discovered to be only about two men and a boy
(natives) amusing themselves&mdash;we presume to frighten us&mdash;with some
gunpowder in cases. To understand the cause of all this alarm, you
must know that ever since the night we were potted at the natives
still hovered around Abu Klea, and we only moved out just in time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
Had we stayed there another day, we should have had a good fight, for
just as the column I was with was about to start, from one of the
outlying posts on the neighbouring hills it was signalled down that the
enemy were seen advancing from Metemmeh direction in thousands;
this caused a good deal of excitement; however, after coming within
about 2 miles of our advanced posts, they all halted and settled down
for the night. Meanwhile the column with sick and wounded got away
and were well clear of all the hills and in a fine open desert by the
time it was dark, and where we halted, as I said before, we were joined
by all the remainder of the garrison that night, they having sneaked out
under cover of the dusk. All the wells we filled up and left fires
burning so as to deceive the enemy. I don’t suppose they found out
we had gone until next morning, and then pretty late, as they would not
have approached the place except very cautiously. It was a very nasty
place to get out of, as for about six miles the road or track runs in a
valley with commanding hills on both sides, and had the enemy made
any attempt to hold the ground at the head, where it emerges into the
desert, very few of us would have got out without scratches. Once in
the desert we did not mind how many came on us, so now you can
understand the commotion caused by the firing of cannon, as we thought
they must have found out and were following us. This of course was
almost impossible, as where they were encamped they had only one or
two wells which they must have dug, and they must have wanted water,
as they could not have got any since they left the river at Metemmeh,
and it would have taken them quite a day to clear out the wells we had
filled in at Abu Klea. In the first 24 hours after leaving Abu Klea
we had done about 30 miles, not bad going for a column on an allowance
of water, in the desert in fact. Everyone had to walk, except the sick
and wounded, because all the camels belonging to the camel corps and
mounted infantry had to be used for transport and baggage animals.
There were only just sufficient to bring us away, and nearly all of them
were completely played out before they commenced the march. However,
we struggled on somehow, and arrived here more dead than alive.
Thank goodness we are getting a day’s rest here, which will enable the
men to pull themselves together, get some decent food and plenty of
water to drink, and that good. If I had been told a month ago that I
should drink as filthy water as I have done, day after day, and been very
thankful to get it, I should have laughed! The thickness of pea-soup
was considered <em>good</em>: sometimes, if it was thicker, then it might be
a little bad, but not to be thrown away. Considering all things, the
desert march has been <em>the</em> most trying thing known in a campaign for
years. By the time we arrive at Korti, we shall have been away five
weeks or more. We shall not have so many difficulties to contend with
henceforward, as the next half will be much easier and I doubt the
enemy following us beyond this. Everything about movements is kept a
State secret here, and we don’t know what is going to happen, except we
move out of this to-morrow or next day&mdash;they say to Merawi, to help
the column gone up the River, but I have my own idea that we are
going straight to Korti, though the Colonel told the officers on parade
yesterday that after a day’s rest here, we were to move towards Merawi.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
It will be getting very hot here soon, and if we are to summer out here,
it would be advisable to try and build ourselves some sort of shelter.
However, I suppose when we get to Korti we shall probably then know
what government has settled to do about the Soudan. I am sure if they
only saw it, they would have no desire ever to keep such a country!”</p></div>

<p>At Gakdul the Royal Irish had a comparatively pleasant rest. A quantity
of stores had recently arrived from Korti, and as there was no means of
carrying them back, the Commissariat distributed them among the troops,
who were regaled on jam, cheese, fresh bread, fresh meat, vegetables, and
other long-forgotten delicacies. The men had time to change their clothes,
there was enough water for washing, and better than all, a great budget of
letters from home awaited the regiment. Some of the units of the column
started at once for Korti, but it was not until the 2nd of March that the
battalion was warned to start next day, an order which was very welcome,
for the wells had begun to give out, and “the water had become filled with
living animals, smelt, and was as fit to drink as a dirty duck pool!” From
the 5th to the 8th the Royal Irish halted at the wells of Megara, where
a successful foray of desert robbers upon the slaughter cattle considerably
reduced their rations of meat. Then they once more pushed northward, this
time in detachments, the last of which reached Korti on the 14th. As Lord
Wolseley rode out to welcome them he saw men whom a civilian would have
derided as tramps and scarecrows, but in whom a soldier’s eye recognised
troops of the finest quality. Their uniforms hung in rags, patched where
patching was possible with any material that had come to hand. Their boots
were a nightmare. Their skins were the colour of mahogany, their faces
seamed with the lines which hunger and thirst, exposure to heat and cold,
want of sleep, and prolonged exertion stamp upon every soldier in a campaign.
Their stern eyes, their hard-set mouths, their steady march and
proud carriage all showed that their spirit and discipline were as high as
ever, and that the great fatigues of their marches in the desert had in no
way impaired the efficiency of the Royal Irish. On the 16th Lord Wolseley
inspected the battalion, warmly thanked all ranks for the work they had done,
and informed them that General Buller had reported on them in the most
favourable terms.</p>

<p>Among those who had done much towards keeping the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">morale</i> of the
XVIIIth at the high standard maintained throughout the Nile campaign was
the Roman Catholic chaplain, the Reverend Father Brindle, D.S.O., now
Bishop of Nottingham, whose name even now is one to conjure with in the
Royal Irish regiment. After serving with the second battalion in the war
of 1882, he accompanied the first battalion throughout the whole of the
expedition up the Nile. His genial personality, his devotion to duty, his
coolness in danger, his indifference to hardship, combined to give him a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
remarkable influence over the men, which he exerted invariably in the
highest interests of the Service.</p>

<p>The Royal Irish thoroughly enjoyed the comparative civilisation of the
headquarters camp. They were once more under canvas; they had an
inexhaustible supply of water; and they feasted their eyes, weary from the
glare of the Bayuda desert, upon the palms and acacias growing on the
narrow strip of cultivation which fringes both banks of the Nile. But they
were not allowed to rest there long. When the rear-guard of the desert
column returned to Korti, the British government were still determined to
avenge Gordon and to crush the Mahdi’s power at Khartoum; and Lord
Wolseley arranged to concentrate the expeditionary force for the summer in
cantonments along the Nile near Korti. The XVIIIth was assigned to a
movable column, commanded by Brigadier-General Brackenbury, whose
headquarters were at Debbeh, with detachments in the neighbouring villages,
one of which, Kurot, was occupied by the Royal Irish, where they settled
down, as they thought for many months. Some of their huts were made
of logs, grass mats, and similar materials, bought from the natives and issued
to the troops; others were built of bricks, made out of the soil on the banks
of the river and dried in the sun. “The battalion,” writes an officer who was
present, “excelled at making the moulds for these bricks, and a sergeant,
Kelly, was the crack moulder.” The want of straw, however, proved as
serious a hindrance to the brick-making of Wolseley’s troops as to the
Israelites of old, for many thousand bricks cracked and were wasted. But
only a fortnight after the last unit had reached its allotted post, Wolseley
was warned by the Cabinet that owing to the possibility of England being
embroiled in war elsewhere, the expedition to Khartoum might be abandoned,
and on the 11th of May he received orders to withdraw from the Soudan.
He obeyed; but as the General-in-Chief in Egypt, who had been studying
the local situation for many months, he strongly protested against the new
policy, pointing out that if we retreated the Mahdi’s power would greatly
increase, and that the British government would not only have to reinforce
the garrison of Egypt, but to fight for the protection of that country. The
difficulty of carrying out the evacuation was greatly increased by the necessity
of bringing back about thirteen thousand natives, who, having thrown in their
lot with us, could not be abandoned to the tender mercies of the Mahdists; but
by dint of careful organisation and hard work the task was accomplished.
General Brackenbury’s command started on the 1st of June in whale-boats for
Abu Fatmeh, where three hundred men of the XVIIIth, under Lieutenant-Colonel
Wray, were landed, and after marching some distance down the Nile
rejoined the remainder of the battalion. Though the difficulties were light
compared to those of the upward voyage, they were by no means insignificant,
for the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voyageurs</i> had gone back to Canada, and the Royal Irish, who acted as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
rear and baggage guard to the column, had much work in towing and mending
whale-boats, wrecked or damaged in shooting the rapids. When the battalion
reached Alexandria, it was joined by a strong draft: a hundred and seventy-nine
non-commissioned officers and men from the second battalion at Malta
had landed in January, of whom fifty-eight had been fortunate enough to be
sent to Suakim, where they served as mounted infantry in the eastern
Soudan. Thus by a curious chance the Royal Irish were represented in the
campaign of 1884-85 not only on the Nile, but also on the shores of the Red
Sea, where a young officer of the regiment, Lieutenant D. G. Gregorie, who
had already greatly distinguished himself while serving in the Egyptian
army, was awarded the fourth class of the order of the Osmanieh.</p>

<p>As a matter of historical interest it may be mentioned that Lord
Wolseley’s predictions proved singularly correct. Within six months of
our withdrawal from Dongola a large body of the enemy attempted
the invasion of Egypt, besieged for forty days a fort held by British
troops, and did not retire southwards until on December 30, 1885, they
had been defeated at the battle of Ginniss. To meet this incursion it was
found necessary to hurry nearly seven thousand British troops up the
Nile, and to increase the garrison of Lower Egypt by about three thousand
men.</p>

<p>In despatches Lord Wolseley mentioned the following officers of the
Royal Irish: Lieutenant-Colonel Shaw, V.C.; Captain Guinness, and Lieutenant
B. J. C. Doran. Lieutenant-Colonel Shaw was awarded the C.B.;
Captain Guinness was promoted to a Brevet-Majority, and Lieutenant
B. J. C. Doran was noted for a Brevet-Majority on his attaining the rank of
Captain. The Egyptian medal and clasp for the Nile, 1884-85, and the
Khedive’s Star were issued to all ranks. In 1886, the regiment was
permitted to add to its battle honours the words, “Nile 1884-5,” in
commemoration of the ascent of the River and the operations in the
Bayuda desert.</p>

<p>The first battalion, Royal Irish regiment embarked at Alexandria
on August 24, 1885, in the s.s. <i>Stirling Castle</i>, and arrived at Plymouth on
September 9.</p>

<span class="fs55">THE BLACK MOUNTAIN EXPEDITION: THE TIRAH CAMPAIGN.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">Early in 1884, the second battalion of the Royal Irish regiment began a long
tour of foreign service. Its first station was at Malta, where drafts from
home brought up its numbers to a total of nine hundred and sixty-seven of
all ranks.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> While at Malta, the battalion heard that the expedition, described
in <a href="#CHAPTER_XII">Chapter xii</a>., was to be sent to the relief of Gordon at Khartoum, and
hoped to be included in it, but the War Office decided otherwise; and though
the Royal Irish were represented in the Nile column, the honour, as we have
seen, fell to the first, not to the second battalion, which remained stationary
till January 7, 1885, when leaving a large detachment as a reinforcement for
the first battalion in Egypt, it sailed for Bombay, and early in February
reached Umballa with a strength of six hundred and fifty-two of all ranks.</p>

<p>A month later the battalion was ordered up to Rawal Pindi to increase the
number of British regiments at a <em>durbar</em>, which the Amir of Afghanistan was
to attend. On the journey the Royal Irish were in a very alarming railway
accident: part of the troop train ran off the line&mdash;three bandsmen, Moore,
Tod, and Frost, were killed; Lieutenant-Colonel Dawson was seriously
injured; Major Hamilton, Lieutenant Symonds, Surgeon-Major Pratt, Bandsman
Hayes, and Drummer Brennan were also hurt. As soon as the <em>durbar</em> was
over the battalion proceeded to Subathu, where, with a detachment at Jutogh, it
remained until November, 1887, when it changed stations for Nowshera, with
detachments at Fort Attock and Cherat. While on the march the Royal
Irish were annoyed by thieves, who hung about the outskirts of the camp in
the hope of stealing modern firearms, for which there was a constant demand
among the hillmen beyond the frontier. To keep their rifles safe, the soldiers
before going to sleep at night used to tie or strap them to their legs, but
even this precaution sometimes failed. On one occasion a small detachment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
secured their firearms in the usual way when they turned into their “E. P.”
tent; but one of the party was not well, and to let him rest comfortably a
comrade slept with both his own and his friend’s rifle fastened to him. In
the middle of the night the Good Samaritan woke, feeling that some one was
stealthily touching him; he instantly raised an alarm, when down fell the
tent, and before the men could crawl from beneath the heavy folds of canvas,
the thieves made off with a rifle. On investigation it was found that the
robbers had noiselessly undone all the tent ropes with the exception of the
four corner ones, which, when their presence in camp was discovered, they
had cut through to cover their retreat. The Royal Irish took such stern
measures to prevent further thefts that the thieves for a considerable time
avoided a battalion which they described as a “<em>Shaitan ki pultan aur Sahiblog
bahut zaberdust</em>.” This may be translated freely&mdash;The Devil’s own regiment
with very high-handed officers!</p>

<p>During the time the second battalion was at Nowshera, one of its
subalterns, Lieutenant W. Gloster, did a very daring piece of work. He
had become noted for his good military sketching, and was specially selected
to do reconnaissance work across the border beyond our frontier post at Hoti
Maidan. His instructions were those which many officers before and since
have received when sent on similar enterprises: he was told that though
it was most desirable that the work should be done, the government would
not be responsible for him: and that on no account was he to cause trouble
on the border: if he liked to apply to the Guides at Hoti Maidan for an escort
he might do so, but in all probability his request would be refused. The
commandant at Hoti Maidan declined to help him, saying that if an escort of
the Guides showed themselves beyond our frontier the whole of the country
might break into a flame. Nothing daunted, Gloster in some mysterious
way made friends with several of the Headmen along the border. “How
he did it,” writes the officer who describes the adventure, “I don’t know, as he
couldn’t speak a word of any language but English, and his only mode
of conversation with his Pathan pals was a tremendous slap on the back, and
‘How are you, old cock?’ One night he was taken across the frontier by
one of his new friends, made his sketch in the early hours of the morning,
and was back on British territory just as his presence was discovered and the
tribesmen were assembling to cut him off.”</p>

<p>On July 22, 1888, Lieutenant-Colonel T. C. Wray, who had been in
command since January 9, 1887, died suddenly of heart disease, and was
succeeded by Lieutenant-Colonel G. W. N. Rogers.</p>

<p>The second battalion in September, 1888, was called upon to take part in a
punitive expedition beyond the north-west frontier of India. Hazara, a
wild and rugged district on the left bank of the river Indus, about eighty
miles east of Peshawar, had long been disturbed by the lawless conduct of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
some of the tribes of mountaineers inhabiting the no-man’s land beyond our
border. The Akazais, the Khan Khel of the Hassanzais and the Alaiwals
raided into our country, looted the villages, and killed peaceful British
subjects; and though punished by the infliction of fines and by being “blockaded”&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>,
debarred from bringing their produce into British territory, they
did not mend their ways. Growing bolder from comparative immunity, they
brought matters to a head by attacking and killing a party of officers and
men who were surveying a part of the Black mountain, within the Queen’s
dominions. To avenge these two Englishmen and the Gurkha soldiers who
were murdered with them; to maintain our prestige in India, and to prevent
an outbreak on other parts of the north-west frontier, a considerable force
was mobilised and placed under the command of Brigadier-General J. W.
M‘Queen, C.B., A.D.C. It consisted of three mountain batteries (two British
and one native), a company of Sappers and Miners, the 1st battalion of the
Suffolk, and the second battalions of the Northumberland Fusiliers, Royal
Irish, and Royal Sussex regiments, eight battalions of native infantry, and
a native pioneer battalion. These troops were organised in two brigades,
commanded respectively by Brigadier-Generals C. N. Channer, V.C., and
W. Galbraith; and to meet the requirements of mountain warfare, in which
it is impossible for one man to supervise the movements of a large body
of soldiers, the brigades were subdivided into two columns, to each of which
a British battalion, 600 strong, and two native regiments were allotted. A
native cavalry regiment, the second battalion of the Seaforth Highlanders,
and a native infantry regiment formed the reserve. The Royal Irish, whom
Major Brereton commanded until Lieutenant-Colonel Rogers returned from
leave at home, were in the fourth column,<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> the other units of which were part
of a British mountain battery, three companies of the 34th Pioneers, the 4th
and 29th Punjab Native infantry, with a field hospital and a detachment of
military telegraphists. The whole force, including some Kashmiri troops and
three hundred of the Khyber rifles, numbered 272 officers and 12,282 non-commissioned
officers and men; the strength of the fourth column was 51
officers and 2414 of the other ranks.</p>

<p>The immediate object of the expedition was the punishment of the
Khan Khel and the Akazais, whose watch-towers and villages were perched
among the crags and precipices of the range which, in some places rising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
to a height of more than 9000 feet, cuts off the valley of Agror from the
left bank of the Indus. It was decided to penetrate into this maze of
mountains from two directions: three columns of the Hazara Field force,
after concentrating at Ughi, the chief British outpost in the Agror valley,
were to cross the range from east to west, while the fourth column, commanded
by Colonel A. C. W. Crookshank, was to assemble fifteen miles to
the south-west of Ughi at Derband, our frontier village on the Indus, and
push northwards up the left bank of the river.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> As this detachment could
not be expected to join hands with the main body for several days, it
was accompanied by General Galbraith, who, while leaving to Colonel
Crookshank the actual handling of the troops, took charge of the general
operations. Though there was little definite information concerning the
prospective theatre of war, it was known that the roads were impracticable
for any but mule transport; so baggage was reduced to a minimum; no
tents were taken, and regimental officers were cut down to fifty, the lower
ranks to sixteen pounds weight of kit. The main body had with it five
days’ supplies and a hundred rounds of ammunition per man, seventy on
the person of the soldier, thirty on mule-back. As the fourth column to
some extent was acting independently, its supply was increased to seven
days, and the number of rounds carried by mules was doubled. A general
reserve of a hundred rounds per man was formed at the base.</p>

<p>The fourth column had finished its concentration on October 1, and
on the morning of the 2nd, Galbraith advanced seven miles into the enemy’s
country and bivouacked at Chamb, on a site he had reconnoitred while
awaiting the arrival of his troops. Here he was informed by telegraph
that owing to delays in bringing up stores to Ughi he was to make no
forward movement for twenty-four hours, so after his mountain guns,
escorted by four companies of the Royal Irish, had driven the enemy from
the neighbouring hills, he improved the track leading from his bivouac
into the valley of the Indus. Before dawn on the 4th, he had secured his
right flank by crowning the heights with a detachment of native infantry,
and as soon as it was light the advance-guard&mdash;two companies of the
Royal Irish under Captain Lysaght&mdash;began to descend into the gorge
of the river.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> At 8 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span> the advance-guard had reached comparatively
open ground, where Lysaght halted to allow the remainder of the troops
to come up; then he pushed on again, and an hour later a few of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
the enemy opened fire from the village of Shingri. The Royal Irish
extended to the left of the hamlet, two companies of native infantry made
a similar movement to the right, and with little difficulty and small loss
the outpost was routed and dispersed. For another mile nothing was
seen of the enemy, but when the advance-guard approached the next
village, Towara, the hillmen were found awaiting our attack. Across the
valley, here about twelve hundred yards in width, stretched their first
line: the right rested on a patch of jungle growing amidst the boulders
on the river bank; the left was posted on the crags of the lowest tier of
the bare and arid mountains which form the eastern wall of the gorge
of the Indus. Rather less than a mile above Towara the valley was
completely closed by a steep spur or under-feature, on the far end of
which the village of Kotkai, built on a huge mass of broken rocks, commanded
not only the spur itself, but also the bed of the river, the hillmen’s
line of retreat and the only track by which the British could continue
to force their way northward up the left bank. On this spur the enemy,
whose total strength was computed at 4000 fighting men,<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> had established
his second line in well-built sangars; and on the eastern hills
lurked about a thousand sharpshooters, armed with rifle and matchlocks,
whose fire upon the valley below them would cross with that of a detachment
of equal strength, posted in breastworks on the heights overhanging
the western bank. Against the hillmen who held this formidable position
General Galbraith could bring into action only his mountain guns, a couple
of Gatlings, and about fourteen hundred foot soldiers, as the remainder
of his men were employed in guarding the baggage and in crowning the
hills in rear of the column.</p>

<p>Galbraith’s first care was to rid his flanks of the enemy. Covered by
the fire of the guns and the steady and well-directed volleys of the Royal
Irish, the 34th Pioneers drove the hillmen from the jungle on the left,
while the 4th Punjab infantry scaled the precipitous heights on the right,
pushing the foe before them in confusion. But the process took time, and
it was not until 1 <span class="fs70">P.M.</span> that the Royal Irish were allowed to move towards
the enemy in the plain, where many flags showed that the tribesmen were
assembled in large numbers. When the battalion had gained six hundred
yards it was halted behind a low stone wall, and ordered to open upon
the foe in front of them, while the guns shelled the defenders of the
Kotkai ridge. By this time, the flanking detachments had done their work
and were once more level with the troops in the centre, and Galbraith,
considering that the hillmen were sufficiently shaken to warrant his assaulting
their first position, ordered a general advance. With perfect steadiness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
the Royal Irish moved forward with sloped arms towards a clump of
trees three or four hundred yards distant; the mountaineers who held this
part of the line were beginning to fall back, when the word “Charge”
was shouted by some unauthorised person whose identity has never been
discovered; the call was sounded by a bugler, and with a wild yell the
battalion dashed forward. They had covered some fifty yards of ground,
when from a nullah about eighty yards off emerged a horde of swordsmen,
Hindustani fanatics, each of whom had sworn to gain Heaven that
day by slaying at least one of the Unbelievers. The suddenness of their
appearance, their demoniacal yells and headlong rush might have startled
any troops, but the Royal Irish were staunch; after an instant of surprised
inaction the company commanders ordered their men to fire independently,
and then to meet the rush with the bayonet. An officer thus described
the affair in his diary: “We got the word to charge; the men went at
them with a will, bayoneting or shooting every Ghazi within reach. The
swordsmen then wheeled away as if they did not quite relish us, and went
towards the 34th Pioneers, who fell back a bit at first but then pulled
themselves together. Our men wheeled up of their own accord and followed
the Ghazis, and I don’t think many got away. We killed or wounded
about a hundred.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> In the pursuit Gloster with one or two dare-devils of
his company dashed after one of the enemy who was carrying a standard,
shot him down, and brought back the flag in triumph.”<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>After the main body of the enemy had been dispersed, several incidents
occurred characteristic of warfare on the north-west frontier of India.
When the fighting appeared to be over, a medical officer, seeing a sepoy
lying hard hit on the plain, went off alone to dress his wounds, and suddenly
found himself surrounded by five Ghazis; one he brought down with his
revolver; the others circled round him, waiting their chance to dash in
and hack him to pieces. The Royal Irish at that moment were re-forming
their ranks; a patrol of an officer and four men hurried to the doctor’s
rescue, and shot three of the fanatics; the fourth came on most pluckily,
and was only ten yards from our men when one of them shot him, and
then pinned him to the ground with his bayonet. These hillmen are
wonderfully tenacious of life, and although the Ghazi had a Martini bullet
through his chest and a bayonet wound in his stomach he strove up to
his last gasp to kill his hated foes. A little later in the day General
Galbraith was the hero of an adventure in which the good marksmanship
of the battalion undoubtedly saved his life. While the Royal Irish were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
sitting on the ground in quarter-column, waiting for orders, the General
on foot, unarmed, and with no escort but his aide-de-camp who was mounted,
walked over the battlefield to ascertain from two friendly hillmen who
accompanied him if any of the dead belonged to tribes which were nominally
neutral.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Suddenly [writes an officer] we heard some shots fired, and looking
up we saw about two or three hundred yards off the General running as
hard as he could towards us, closely followed by some Ghazis. The
A.D.C.’s pony had became unmanageable so he could not fire, and the
Ghazis were catching the General up; we accordingly ordered two or
three picked shots to fire&mdash;risky work, for the fanatics were within
a few yards of the General and he almost masked our fire. Still the
risk had to be taken, and (luckily perhaps) as we fired, the General
stumbled and fell, and the whole of the Ghazis were shot. We heard
afterwards that when the General was examining the corpses, two
of the supposed ‘deaders’ had jumped up and gone for him, and being
unarmed, he could do nothing but run. The ‘friendlies,’ seeing the
General’s plight, had gone for the Ghazis, and as they were all dressed
alike, we were unable to tell friend from foe, and had shot all four
of them.”</p></div>

<p>In the course of the afternoon a hospital was established in a clump
of trees, among which stood a shrine packed with the furniture and other
belongings of some of the tribesmen with whom we were at war. From
one of these trees a Ghazi was dislodged by a bullet; the sound of the
shot brought up a couple of our men who, suspecting that more fanatics
were in hiding, began to rummage among the lumber in the shrine, where
two more Ghazis were discovered to whom very short shrift was allowed.
When the advance was resumed, half the battalion was ordered to keep
down the fire from the sangars on the right bank of the river, while the
other companies and part of the 29th Punjab infantry climbed the ridge
and moved upon Kotkai. They entered it without opposition, for the enemy,
already shaken by the shells of the mountain battery, retired before them
to Kunhar, a village two or three miles higher up the river. By the time
we were in possession of the Kotkai position the day was so far spent
that pursuit had become impossible, and the wing of the Royal Irish was
sent down to bivouac in the plain, while the native regiment remained
to hold the village as an advanced post.</p>

<p>The next few days were full of varied occupations. The battalion
marched with convoys of sick to Chamb, carried stores over rocks that the
mules could not face, escorted the General up precipitous mountains when
he visited tribes of doubtful loyalty to arrange the terms on which their
neutrality was to be secured, and for more than one day carried on a long
musketry fight with the hillmen, who had now flocked to the farther side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
of the river, whence they maintained a harassing fire upon our working
parties. Under the steady shooting of the Royal Irish, the enemy gradually
melted away, and when the British brought river craft up the Indus to
replace the ferry-boats which had been destroyed, the mountaineers realised
that the river was no longer an impassable barrier and disappeared, leaving
the road-makers unmolested in their heavy task of converting mere goat-tracks
on the side of a cliff into roads wide enough for the passage of
heavily laden mules in single file. On the 11th the whole column reached
Kunhar, though the road was still so rough that over the greater part of
it the baggage had to be passed by hand. The 12th was spent in improving
the path to Gazikot, a mile or two higher up the river; and on the 13th,
Galbraith transported the Royal Irish and part of his native infantry across
the river in boats, marched through various deserted villages, and blew up a
hill fortress at Maidan. The tribesmen watched his proceedings from the
neighbouring heights, and when he began to retire attacked his rear-guard,
but were driven back, and the column regained the left bank without difficulty.
After the destruction of Maidan the enemy began to lose heart, and
though the troops in the fourth column made several raids into the mountains
on each side of the Indus, occupying villages so filthy that the Europeans
could not sleep in the houses and had to bivouac upon the roofs, they did not
again come under hostile fire. On all these operations the Royal Irish
were employed, and in their spare time Galbraith found plenty of occupation
for them in the unexciting but very arduous work of improving the
communications with the frontier of India.</p>

<p>While the fourth column was forcing its way up the Indus the other
columns pushed eastwards from the Agror valley. They climbed mountains,
made roads, destroyed watch-towers, and burned hostile villages with small
loss, for they met with no opposition such as that which had awaited
Galbraith at Kotkai, and their casualties were mainly caused by the
“snipers” who harassed their bivouacs at night. Thus taken between two
fires, the Hassanzais and Akazais learned that though slow to rouse, the
Government of India when it begins to strike, does so with effect. Astonished
to find that the fastnesses of the country could be reached by regular troops,
dismayed at the loss of several hundred of their fighting men, and realising
that the longer they deferred their submission, the heavier would be their
punishment, these clans decided to surrender; paid the heavy fines imposed
upon them, and promised amendment for the future. During the negotiations
there was an episode in which Lieutenant Gloster played an amusing part,
thus described by one of his brother officers&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When the hillmen with whom we had been fighting came to the
conclusion that for the time being they had had enough of it, they began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
to send Jirgahs or deputations of headmen to interview General Galbraith,
who had very little knowledge of the manners and customs of the
Border tribes. Presuming on his ignorance of frontier etiquette, they
used to behave towards him with gross impertinence: they would walk
into his hut and greet his Pathan orderlies, who acted as interpreters,
with great respect, but take no notice of the General himself; then sit
down without being asked, and finally spit on the floor&mdash;a particularly
gross form of insult throughout the East. Gloster who since the engagement
at Kotkai had been orderly officer to the General, was present
at these interviews and used to boil with rage, but as his chief took
no notice he had to swallow his wrath as best he could. But Gloster’s
chance came when <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Colonel . . . '">Colonel &mdash;&mdash;</ins>, an officer of long experience on the
frontier, joined the column and took over the conduct of the negotiations
for peace. On the morning after <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Colonel . . . '">Colonel &mdash;&mdash;</ins>’s arrival the tribesmen
walked into the new-comer’s hut with their usual swagger and went
through their customary insulting performances&mdash;but not for long, as
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Colonel . . . '">Colonel &mdash;&mdash;</ins> turned upon them, first with a volley of abuse in Hindustani
and Pushtu, and then with his stick and boots. In amazement
they made for the door, and then as each astonished Pathan passed out,
he got a blow on the side of the head from a huge fist, followed by
a hearty kick from a long and powerful leg. A very chastened and
exceedingly polite deputation returned to make terms next day!”</p></div>

<p>As soon as the Hassanzais and Akazais had made their peace with the
Indian government, a portion of General M‘Queen’s command moved northwards
to punish other recalcitrant tribes; but as the fourth column played no
part in these operations it is not necessary to describe them. As far as the
Royal Irish are concerned, the only incident during the remainder of the
Black Mountain campaign was the visit of the Commander-in-Chief in India,
General Sir Frederick Roberts, who on the 28th of October inspected the second
battalion at Palosi, and complimented all ranks on their behaviour during this
little mountain war. Early in November the expedition had finished its
work; the columns marched back across the British frontier, and the Royal
Irish, passing through Durband, arrived at their old station of Nowshera
on the 23rd of the month.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>General Galbraith in a farewell order thanked all ranks of the fourth
column for the admirable manner in which they had performed their duties,
adding that their exemplary behaviour and unvarying good discipline had not
been less conspicuous than their conduct in the field. His official report on the
operations of the river column mentioned Major R. K. Brereton and Lieutenant
W. Gloster, Royal Irish regiment, and the Roman Catholic chaplain attached
to the battalion, Father Francis Van Mansfeld, who during the fighting on
October 4, distinguished himself by carrying water to the wounded under a
heavy fire. The losses of the Hazara Field force during this short campaign
were small: the total casualties, including two officers mortally wounded, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
less than a hundred. In the second battalion of the Royal Irish two men
were killed and three wounded in action, while two were fatally injured
by falling down a precipice.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
The Indian Medal with a clasp for “Hazara 1888” was granted to the
troops who took part in this expedition.</p>

<p>Until December, 1889, the second battalion remained at Nowshera; then it
was stationed for a short time at Peshawar, and in April, 1890, headquarters
and four companies were moved to Cherat, where the medals for the Hazara
campaign were presented on parade by Mrs Rogers, the wife of the officer who
then commanded the battalion. The year 1890 was memorable in the sporting
annals of the regiment. After having been in the final tie for the Infantry polo
tournament for three years running, the officers of the second battalion won
it at Umballa with a team composed of Captain Apthorp, Lieutenants
Cullinan, Kellett, Wynne, and Garraway&mdash;the last mentioned taking the
place of Wynne, who met with an accident during the game. The non-commissioned
officers and men also had a triumph in winning the Calcutta
football tournament. The month of December found the second battalion
on the way to Lucknow, where they remained till November, 1894, when
a five weeks’ march brought them to Jubbulpore, an excellent centre for
big game shooting. The officers lost no opportunity of going after tiger, and
Lieutenant J. B. S. Alderson had a very exciting adventure in which his life
was saved by the coolness of Lieutenant-Colonel Lawrence, then in command
of the battalion. In the Chitri jungle Alderson was following up a wounded
tiger on foot, when the beast charged and seized him by the arm. Colonel
Lawrence rushed to the rescue, and with three steady shots killed it, but not
without much difficulty, for as the huge brute lay upon Alderson mauling his
arm, the bullets had to be placed so that they would strike the animal without
doing his victim any harm. When Alderson was brought into hospital, he
was so weak from shock, fatigue, and loss of blood that it was pronounced
unsafe to put him under chloroform, and it was nearly midnight before all his
numerous wounds were dressed. Though suffering agonies he never uttered a
word, except from time to time to ask one of his brother officers, who were
standing round his bed, to fill and light the pipe, which he did not allow
to go out during the operation. His right arm had been bitten through, but
neither the bones nor arteries were injured, and he recovered&mdash;to meet a
soldier’s death a few years later in the South African war.</p>

<p>During the cold weather of 1896-97 the second battalion was inspected
by the Lieutenant-General commanding in Bengal, who pronounced it to be
“in first-rate order, in a very efficient condition, and quite fit for active
service.” The Commander-in-Chief in India considered this “a very satisfactory
report on the battalion, which appears to be very well commanded by
Colonel Lawrence.” A few months after this inspection matters began to go
badly on the frontier, where for some time past fanatical priests had been
preaching “a Holy War” against the English. The first tangible symptom
of unrest was a treacherous attack by the hillmen of the Tochi valley upon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
British officer and his escort; then followed an outbreak in the Swat valley,
where the tribes suddenly fell in thousands upon our post at Malakand. The
garrison fought gallantly, and in spite of enormous odds held their ground
for several days until the enemy were dispersed by a relieving column. The
Mohmands were the next to rise, and finally the Afridis and Orakzais took
up arms against us. To meet this formidable though fortunately ill-combined
attack, troops were hurried to the frontier; among them were the Royal Irish,
who on August 13, 1897, received the order to mobilise for active service.
The news was welcomed by the battalion with wild enthusiasm, and proved
so good a tonic to the large number of non-commissioned officers and men
who, though apparently recovered from the malarial fever prevalent at
Jubbulpore, still had the seeds of the disease lurking in their system, that
eight hundred and twenty-seven of all ranks were passed by the doctors.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> In
two days everything was in readiness, and on August 15, the Royal Irish
entrained for Rawal Pindi. The journey, at that time of year always an
exhausting one, was made doubly trying by the result of a railway accident;
the troop trains, timed to reach Pindi early in the morning, did not arrive
there till nearly midnight, and by some departmental blunder the battalion
was left all day without food or shelter from the sun. At Khasalghur, where
the rail ended, the Royal Irish had very heavy work, loading and reloading
stores in extreme heat. Then followed several forced marches, in the first
of which they escorted a convoy four or five miles in length for twenty-six
miles over a very rugged country, drained by two rivers passable only at
deep fords. When they joined Major-General Yeatman-Biggs in the Miranzai
valley, they found his column at Hangu, a village at the base of the foot
hills of the great Samana ridge, where the camp, pitched on fields from which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
the crops had just been reaped, stood on ground saturated by the heavy rain
of the monsoon. In a previous campaign on the frontier, an imperfectly
entrenched British force had been attacked at night by a horde of hillmen,
whose determined rush was not repelled without great difficulty and hard
fighting. Mindful of this episode, Yeatman-Biggs had ringed his camp with
works, which were occupied by the troops at night, when, to avoid offering a
target to “snipers,” the tents were struck. As the weather was very wet and
steamy, it was impossible for the men ever to get their clothes thoroughly
dried, and during the fortnight that the headquarters of the battalion remained
at Hangu there was much fever among those who were unlucky
enough to be left in camp,<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> but the companies sent on detachment kept in
good health and accomplished the remarkable marches mentioned in Colonel
Lawrence’s order, quoted in <a href="#APPENDIX_5">appendix 5</a>.</p>

<p>On the evening of September 12, General Yeatman-Biggs issued orders for
his column to march forthwith to the rescue of a party of the 36th Sikhs,
who were hard pressed in Fort Gulistan, an advanced post on the Samana
ridge. At that moment the battalion was so reduced by detachments and by
sickness that only two hundred and ninety-five Royal Irishmen were present
to take part in the arduous operations by which the Gulistan garrison was
relieved on the 13th. After this success Yeatman-Biggs was ordered to
remain on the Samana; the sick of the battalion were sent up from the
hospitals below, and in the pure air of the mountains rapidly regained their
health. In addition to the ordinary camp guards, duties, and fatigues the
battalion was employed in road-making and in reconnaissances among the
hills; and in high spirits and absolutely unaware that they had been reported
upon unfavourably, all ranks anxiously awaited orders for a farther advance
into the enemy’s country, when a telegram reached Colonel Lawrence from a
civilian friend at Rawal Pindi, telling him of a rumour that the Royal Irish
were to be ordered back from the front for garrison duty in India. Colonel
Lawrence at once went to the General, who said it was true that the battalion
was to go back, as the doctors reported it to be saturated with malaria. At
the Colonel’s request a medical board was assembled, whose members were
instructed to be very thorough and searching in their examination, and to
pass no one who was not thoroughly fit for the hard work of active service.
The doctors did not see the whole of the battalion, as a hundred and fifty
officers and men were absent on detachment, but out of those whom they
inspected, five hundred and twenty-three were passed as absolutely fit, and
above the average physique of the army. With this favourable report in his
hand, Colonel Lawrence made every effort to obtain the recision of the order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
but without success; and on September 30, appeared the following paragraph
in Major-General Yeatman-Biggs’ Field Force orders: “under instructions
from Army Headquarters, Simla, the 2nd battalion, Royal Irish regiment, is
to proceed to Rawal Pindi for garrison duty, on relief by the 2nd Derbyshire
regiment.”</p>

<p>It will be observed that no reason was given for the removal of the
battalion from the fighting line; and soon after the Royal Irish reached
Rawal Pindi rumours, most injurious to their character as soldiers, became
current in civilian circles and found their way first into the Indian and then
into the British newspapers. Major-General Sir Henry Havelock-Allan, the
Colonel of the regiment, was in England when these rumours were repeated
by the London press; and stirred to the heart by the aspersions on the fair
fame of the corps with which he had so long and honourable a connection, he
hurried to India to investigate the truth of these stories. Shortly after the
second battalion returned to Rawal Pindi Colonel Lawrence was appointed to
the command of the XVIIIth regimental district; but before leaving India he
went to Simla to ascertain if possible why the battalion had been so unjustly
treated. He was unable to obtain an interview with the Commander-in-Chief,
but from the Adjutant-General he learned that, several days before the medical
board had been convened, General Yeatman-Biggs had reported that the Royal
Irish were so saturated with malaria that they could not keep up with the
rest of the column. As General Havelock-Allan and Colonel Lawrence
crossed on the voyage without meeting in any port, the former landed at
Bombay with an unbiassed mind; without stopping to see the battalion at
Rawal Pindi he hastened to the frontier, and after the fullest inquiries in
every direction was able to assert proudly that the Royal Irish had behaved
like good soldiers in the Tirah campaign. By his tragic death in the Khyber
Pass at the end of December, the regiment apparently lost its only influential
friend in the East, and when, shortly afterwards, the authorities at Simla
refused to grant the board of inquiry for which Lieutenant-Colonel Forster
had applied in order to refute the libels on his battalion, the spirits of all
ranks sank very low. The dignified attitude of the officers under misfortune
won universal respect and admiration at Pindi; and it speaks well for the
discipline of the battalion that in such distressing circumstances there was
no sign of angry feeling among the men, and that all ranks, knowing that
there was no grounds for the aspersions made against them in the press,
possessed their souls in patience until their conduct should be investigated
by an authority even higher than that of Simla.</p>

<p>While Havelock-Allan was on the frontier he had laid the grievances of
the Royal Irish before General Sir William Lockhart, who was in command
of all the troops engaged in the Tirah campaign; and after Lockhart had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
seen the battalion at Havelock-Allan’s funeral at Pindi, he exerted himself
so vigorously on its behalf that, after being closely inspected by the chief
army doctor in India, it was ordered back to the front, and on February 9,
1898, joined the third brigade, under Colonel (now Lieutenant-General Sir
Ian) Hamilton, in the Bara valley. Thence it moved up to Barkai, where
the expeditionary force received the Royal Irish with open arms. “The fuss
that has been made over us is wonderful,” wrote an officer of the XVIIIth.
“Every general within fifteen miles of Barkai rode over to congratulate the
regiment in the names of their respective commands, and the officers were
inundated with shoals of complimentary telegrams.” Unfortunately, as far
as Hamilton’s brigade was concerned, all fighting was over when the battalion
was allowed to return to the front, and thus it had no opportunity of again
meeting the enemy; but still it had been sent back to the fighting line, and
thus from the military point of view its honour was completely vindicated.
One thing, however, was still needed to re-establish the second battalion in
the eyes of civilians&mdash;a letter from Army headquarters at Simla clearing it
from the charges made against it in the newspapers. Such a letter arrived
on the 17th of February, but being marked “confidential” could not be sent
to the public press for publication. When Colonel Lawrence received from
the second battalion a copy of this confidential letter, he rightly considered
that for the complete exoneration of the Royal Irish he should be permitted
to make its contents known to the world; he accordingly asked leave of
Colonel Gough, Secretary to Lord Wolseley, then Commander-in-Chief of the
British Army, to publish it to the brigade of regular and militia battalions of
the Royal Irish territorial regiment, about to assemble at Kilworth under his
orders. In reply “as an exceptional case and in view of his proceeding to
Kilworth where other battalions of the regiment are stationed” he received
an extract from a letter from the Adjutant-General to the Commander-in-Chief,
India, which runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I am directed by the Secretary of State to inform you that a perusal
of the papers connected with the withdrawal of the 2nd battalion, Royal Irish
regiment from the field force on the North-West frontier has satisfied the
Commander-in-Chief that a grave injustice was done to the 2nd battalion,
Royal Irish regiment when it was recalled from field service.”</p>

<p>Colonel Lawrence immediately published this complete exoneration in an
order to the troops at Kilworth (see <a href="#APPENDIX_5">appendix 5</a>).</p>

<p>In order that the public should realise how completely the charges against
the Royal Irish had been refuted, it was suggested that some signal honour
should be conferred upon the regiment. Her Majesty Queen Victoria, always
remembering the XVIIIth when they guarded her at Windsor, had been
much concerned at the libels on her Irish soldiers; she at once appreciated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
the importance of proving to the world that the rumours about the second
battalion were absolutely without foundation, and by her command Lord
Wolseley was appointed to be the first Colonel-in-Chief of the Royal Irish
regiment. This mark of the Queen’s favour closed the Tirah incident, the
most painful episode in the long history of the regiment.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As the second battalion was not one of the corps fortunate enough to be
sent from India to South Africa for the Boer war, the record of its service
during the remainder of the period embraced by this history is almost barren
of interest. In February, 1900, the Royal Irish distinguished themselves at
Mhow in putting out a dangerous fire, and were specially thanked by Major-General
Nicholson, C.B., who commanded the district&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The General Officer Commanding wishes to convey to the troops in
garrison, his thanks for the excellent work done by them during the last
few days in endeavouring to extinguish the recent fire in the Commissariat
stack-yard. The promptitude with which Officers and men of the
Royal Irish regiment turned out on the first alarm undoubtedly saved
the remainder of the stacks at the time, and the zeal evinced and arduous
work done by all the troops in garrison on that and subsequent days has
been fully appreciated by the General Officer Commanding, and he will
have much pleasure in bringing the same to the notice of the Lieutenant-General
Commanding, Bombay Command.”</p></div>

<p>A month later the battalion learned from Army Orders that to commemorate
the gallantry of the Irish regiments in the recent battles in South
Africa, the Queen had ordered that in future all ranks of these corps should
wear on St Patrick’s Day a sprig of shamrock in their head-dresses&mdash;a
recognition of national sentiment which caused great satisfaction to both
battalions of the XVIIIth, and to every other Irish regiment in Her Majesty’s
army.</p>

<p>In the ordinary course of Indian reliefs the second battalion was due to
turn its face homewards in the autumn of 1900, but owing to the war in
South Africa all such arrangements were cancelled, and the Royal Irish were
ordered to remain at Mhow, where they were still quartered when in July,
1901, Lieutenant-Colonel J. Burton-Forster, relinquishing the command on
appointment to the Staff, was succeeded by Lieutenant-Colonel H. S.
Shuldham-Lye. The dislocation of reliefs was not the only effect produced
on the second battalion by the South African war. As every recruit, as soon
as he was fit for active service, was sent to join the first battalion, there was
great danger that the second battalion would become dangerously weak if
the time-expired men left India at the end of their engagement to serve with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
the Colours. As every battalion in India was in a similar plight the government
offered liberal terms to men willing to re-engage, viz.&mdash;a bounty of £10
with a two months’ furlough at home, or an additional bounty of £16 in lieu
of furlough to all ranks below the rank of sergeant, who had completed six
years and three months’ colonial service, and who had not entered upon the
twelfth year of such service. The men who accepted these terms were to
engage to extend their service so as to complete twelve years with the
Colours. Twenty-two of the Royal Irish accepted the £10 bounty with
furlough; two hundred and ninety-seven preferred to have £26 paid into
their hands, and did not take a holiday at home.</p>

<p class="noindent">For nearly four years after the return of the first battalion to England in
1885 it was quartered alternately at Plymouth and Devonport. During this
time only three events of importance occurred in its history. In February,
1886, General Sir Richard Dennis Kelly, K.C.B.,<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> from the Prince of Wales’s
Leinster Regiment (Royal Canadians), was appointed Colonel of the Royal
Irish regiment, <em>vice</em> Lieutenant-General and Honorary General Sir Alexander
MacDonell, K.C.B., transferred to the Rifle Brigade. New Colours were presented
to the battalion on September 7, 1886, at Devonport, by the Lady
Albertha Edgcumbe, daughter of the Earl of Mount Edgcumbe, at a ceremony
marked by a departure from precedent; hitherto the Colours of the Royal
Irish had always been consecrated by a clergyman of the Church of England,
but on this occasion the service was performed by a Roman Catholic priest in
recognition of the fact that the large majority of the rank and file were
members of the Church of Rome. In the Gazette of March 9, 1889, Sir
Richard Kelly was transferred to the command of the Border regiment, and
was succeeded by Lieutenant-General and Honorary General George Frederick
Stephenson Call, C.B.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> From Plymouth the battalion, six hundred and
ninety-nine of all ranks, under Lieutenant-Colonel A. J. A. Jackson, was
ordered in May, 1889, to Colchester, where it was inspected by its new
Colonel, General Call, who after serving in the XVIIIth in China, Burma,
and the Crimea, had commanded it in India. While at Colchester two serious
misfortunes happened. In the autumn of 1889 the sergeants’ mess was
burned down, and in it were lost several cups and trophies, and worse than
all, the two engravings given by the late King Edward VII. to the non-commissioned
officers during his visit to India while he was Prince of Wales.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
Nearly two years later, on July 31, 1891, the officers’ mess hut met with a
similar fate. A little past midnight, after the mess had been closed, an officer
discovered that the building was on fire. The alarm was at once given; not
only the Royal Irish, but the whole of the garrison turned out, but their
united efforts, coupled with those of the town fire-brigade, failed to master
the flames, and the hut and nearly all it contained was destroyed. There
were several gallant but fruitless attempts to save the Colours; and it was
only at great personal risk that Private W. O’Neill succeeded in bringing
away the silver model of a whale-boat, the trophy commemorating the battalion’s
success in the race up the Nile. Among the few things rescued was
the snuff-box, which, as already mentioned on <a href="#Footnote_146_146">page 146</a>, was the only piece of
regimental plate saved from the wreck of the <i>Buckinghamshire</i> in 1851.</p>

<p>Late in the autumn of 1891 the battalion was ordered to Ireland, and
arrived at the Curragh in November under Lieutenant-Colonel J. D. Edge,
whose marching-in state showed a strength of 697 officers and men. Next
year, on November 14, new Colours were presented by Lady Wolseley, to
replace those lost in the fire at Colchester. At the end of the ceremony
Lord Wolseley addressed the Royal Irish, and after reminding his audience
that throughout his military career he had been intimately associated with
the regiment, he continued as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I served side by side with it in Burma when I was very young. I
met it again in the Crimea, and I can well remember what pride I felt
as an Irishman in its gallant conduct on the 18th June, 1855. It also
served in India whilst I was there during the Mutiny, and it must be in
the remembrance of many of those who are now on parade that we were
comrades together during the war in Egypt in 1882. I remember well,
in the first streak of dawn on the desert of Tel-el-Kebir, seeing the
Royal Irish among the first to cross the entrenchments, and again, two
years later, we met on the Nile, in which expedition they played a distinguished
part. I felt proud that they should have been the winners of
a prize which was offered to the battalion which made the journey up
the river in the shortest time. I have a very much prized trophy of the
expedition which was given me by one for whom I have the greatest
respect&mdash;one of the very best men and best soldiers I ever knew&mdash;I refer
to Father Brindle, your former chaplain, who accompanied you from
Cairo up the river, and then across the Desert to Gubat. The trophy is
the flag of the boat in which he made the voyage up the Nile; it is
marked ‘H Company, Royal Irish.’ Yours is one of the oldest regiments
in the army. When first raised it was named ‘The regiment of Ireland.’
That name was changed by William III. to the Royal Irish regiment, as
a reward, a distinction for your gallant services at the taking of Namur.
If I were to enter into detailed history of the regiment it would be to give
a history of the British army, for the history of one may be said to be
the history of the other. I chanced to read an old book the other day,
describing the wars of the early part of the last century, in which it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
stated that the discipline, system of drill, and fighting, training of the
army then had been copied from the discipline and military system long
established in the Royal Irish regiment. As you know from the names
of the battles on your Colours you shared in all the glories of the Duke
of Marlborough, and although hereafter I have no doubt you will add
many names to these Colours&mdash;for we shall have wars as long as the
world lasts&mdash;no greater victory than that of Blenheim or Ramillies can
ever be shared in by any regiment. Now, what is the value of all this
glory to a regiment, or to the army of which it is a part? It is this, it
intensifies the pride of the regiment, and the pride of that Empire to
which we all belong; it is an incentive to those who come after us to
imitate, and, if possible, to excel the deeds of their forefathers. May
God bless these Colours and prosper this fine old distinguished regiment.”</p></div>

<p>After three years at the Curragh the battalion was ordered to Limerick,
where it arrived early in November, 1894. The Royal Irish had hardly
settled down in their new quarters when they lost their Lieutenant-Colonel,
J. D. Edge, who died in Dublin on the 15th of December, and less than a
month later General Call followed him to the grave. Lieutenant-Colonel
J. H. A. Spyer succeeded to the command of the battalion: General Call
was replaced by Lieutenant-General and Honorary General R. W. M‘L. Fraser,
on whose transfer to the Royal Warwickshire regiment less than a year
later, Major-General and Honorary Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Havelock-Allan,
V.C., a former officer of the XVIIIth, was appointed to fill the vacancy
on November 22, 1895.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1896 news reached England of a dangerous native
rising in Rhodesia, a huge territory lately added to the possessions of
Britain, and bounded to the north by the Zambesi river, to the east by
Portuguese East Africa, and to the south by the Transvaal. The distances
in the theatre of war were so enormous, and the mobility of the enemy so
great, that the War Office determined to reinforce the troops in South
Africa with foot soldiers who could ride, and the battalions at home were
called upon to furnish detachments of officers and men who had been
trained to act as mounted infantry. Lieutenant S. G. French was selected
to command the contingent from the Royal Irish, and with thirty non-commissioned
officers and men, formed part of a composite unit known
as the Irish Company, mounted infantry. They embarked on May 2, 1896;
landed at Cape Town, and after remaining some time encamped at Wynberg,
sailed to Beira, the harbour in Portuguese territory from which Rhodesia
could be approached most easily by sea. Thanks to the courtesy of the
Government at Lisbon, our troops were allowed to make use of the port,
and to pass through the belt of coast land between the ocean and the frontier
of Rhodesia. Once arrived at Salisbury, the principal British settlement in
our new territory, the handful of Royal Irish were allotted to a column<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
under Lieutenant-Colonel E. A. H. Alderson, and were employed in pacifying
northern Mashonaland. This is not the place to describe the expedition:
it is enough to say that the representatives of the regiment did well on
every occasion when they were engaged.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> In Colonel Alderson’s report
of November 25, 1897, he stated that “the detachment under Lieutenant
French did their work excellently in every way, especially when on active
service in Mashonaland. After the action at Makia’s Kraal on August 30,
1896, I had much pleasure in reporting them to Sir Frederick Carrington,
K.C.B., K.C.M.G., commanding the forces in Rhodesia, as follows: ‘I should
like to mention the ready way in which the Royal Irish section of the
Irish Company, Mounted Infantry, followed Lieutenant French across a
considerable piece of open ground under a brisk fire.’” When Lieutenant
French and his detachment returned to England they rejoined headquarters
where the medal, issued to all who took part in the campaign, was presented
to them in due course.</p>

<p>The Royal Irish were so popular in Limerick that, when it became
known that the first battalion was to move to Dublin in the autumn, the
townspeople petitioned the Government to allow it to remain for another
year. When the request was granted the Corporation took the opportunity
of presenting the commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Spyer, with
a very complimentary address, containing many references to the uniformly
good conduct of the regiment, and to the high esteem with which it was
regarded by all creeds and classes of the population. The Royal Irish
were still quartered in Limerick at the time of the Jubilee celebrating the
completion of the sixtieth year of Her Majesty Queen Victoria’s reign.
Certain disloyalists attempted to mar the rejoicings by hoisting a black
flag upon one of the islands of the Shannon; the local authorities were
most anxious to remove this emblem of treason, but the owners of the
river boats, intimidated by the rabble, refused the large sum of money
offered for the use of their craft, and there appeared no means of reaching
the obnoxious flag, when Private &mdash;&mdash; Cullen, Royal Irish regiment, came
to the rescue, and, to quote from the account of his gallant feat which
appeared in the London ‘Globe’ of July 5, 1897,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“lowering himself by a rope from the barracks, which overhang the
river, he plunged in, and struck out for the rock. Crowds congregated
on the opposite bank, and some at least&mdash;for there are many in Limerick
too loyal and too sensible to be the playthings of vindictive agitators&mdash;watched
his progress through the fierce current in mental trepidation. He
reached the rock, tore up the pole and flag, and not daring to return
in the teeth of the stream, swam with his capture to the bank. It was
only after a long and hard struggle that he was able to make land, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
a strong body of police met and escorted him back to barracks. Had
it not been for the police, serious if not fatal injuries would have been
done him, as a great crowd of women were prepared to stone him as
he approached.”</p></div>

<p>At the end of 1897, the Royal Irish regiment heard with deep regret of
the death of their Colonel, Sir Henry Havelock-Allan, V.C., who, while in
India to disprove the charges brought against the second battalion, was killed
in the Khyber Pass on December 31, 1897. He was succeeded by Major-General
C. F. Gregorie, C.B.,<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> who had commanded the second battalion
at Tel-el-Kebir. In the summer of 1898, as has been already mentioned,
Her Majesty Queen Victoria paid the regiment the very high honour of
directing that Field-Marshal the Right Honourable Garnet, Viscount Wolseley,
K.P., G.C.B., G.C.M.G., Colonel Royal Horse Guards, Commander-in-Chief,
should be appointed Colonel-in-Chief of the Royal Irish regiment.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p>In August, 1898, the first battalion moved to Buttevant with many regrets,
for officers and men alike had found Limerick an ideal station. The racing
was good, the hunting excellent,<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> the inhabitants were hospitable and
thoroughly appreciated the good qualities of the Royal Irish, whom they
had grown to look upon as personal friends. In the autumn of 1898, the
bronze medal of the Royal Humane Society was presented to Lieutenant
E. M. Panter-Downes by Colonel W. W. Lawrence, commanding the XVIIIth
regimental district; the circumstances in which this decoration was won
are set out in the following extract from Colonel Lawrence’s speech on
parade, when he pinned the medal on to the recipient’s breast:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have a very pleasing duty to perform this morning, and that is
to present to Mr Panter-Downes, of the 1st battalion, the Royal Humane
Society’s medal for risking his life to save that of a gentleman at Kilkee,
Co. Clare, in August last. Captain Vigors and Mr Panter-Downes went
to bathe that morning. There was a very heavy sea running, and the
waves were breaking over the rocks. They noticed a man’s clothes
on the cliff, but saw nothing of him at the time. Shortly after they
saw him in the water, in a very exhausted condition, almost at the last
gasp. Mr Panter-Downes at once jumped in and swam thirty or forty
yards through the surf to the drowning man. He secured him, and
with him swam back to the iron ladder used by bathers, where Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
Vigors met him, and between the two of them they got the man in
safely. When they were on the ladder the waves were washing over
them, and they were in danger of being carried away.”</p></div>

<p>On Colonel W. W. Lawrence’s retirement from the service he was
succeeded in command of the 18th regimental district by Colonel J. H. A.
Spyer, who was promoted Colonel on the 16th of January, 1899. In the
same Gazette Major H. W. N. Guinness was promoted to be Lieutenant-Colonel.
The autumn of 1899 found the battalion still quartered in Ireland,
with the eyes of all ranks turned upon South Africa, where the course
of political events showed with ever-increasing clearness that the South
African republics were determined to force a war upon Great Britain. The
causes of the quarrel are too complex to be discussed in a regimental history;
from the soldier’s point of view the all-important question was whether
England was to continue the paramount power in South Africa or to be
ousted by the Dutch republics, and the earnest hope of every man in the
regiment was that the XVIIIth would be allowed to take part in the struggle
in which this great question was to be decided. For a time this hope seemed
destined not to be fulfilled, for though Captain S. E. St Leger was appointed
to command a company of mounted infantry, of which a section was provided
by the Royal Irish,<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> the first battalion was not among the troops
selected for the “Expeditionary Force” despatched to the seat of war in
October and November. The officers made every effort to induce the War
Office to send the battalion to South Africa, but failed to obtain anything
more definite than a promise that if more troops were required, every
attention would be paid to the desire of the Royal Irish to be actively employed.
When it was decided to strengthen the expeditionary force with
another division, the 5th, the battalion hoped to find a place in one of
its brigades, but it was not included in General Warren’s command, and
until the beginning of December there seemed no prospect that it would
take part in the Boer war. The Royal Irish were then at Aldershot,
where they had arrived on November 24, to join the second battalions of
the Bedfordshire, Worcestershire, and Wiltshire regiments in the 12th infantry
brigade, commanded by Colonel, afterwards Major-General R. A. P. Clements.
They had not yet thoroughly settled down in their new quarters when
they were roused to the highest pitch of enthusiasm by the news that the
12th brigade was to mobilise forthwith, and to start in a few days for
South Africa as part of Lieutenant-General Kelly-Kenny’s newly formed
division, the 6th. Then began a rush so tremendous that those who went
through it now look back on the time between the 2nd of December, when
the orders were received, and the 16th, when the battalion sailed, as a
nightmare; there was an enormous amount of work to be done; the days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
were very short; the barracks were badly lighted; everyone was at fever
heat with excitement; and the strain upon the officers and non-commissioned
officers was quite indescribable. All men over twenty years of age had to be
medically examined to see if they were fit for active service; clothing and
equipment for the field had to be drawn and fitted, and arrangements made
for the well-being of the women and children of the battalion, whether “on”
or “off” the strength; the reserve men had to be brought over from Clonmel,
armed, clothed, and fitted out in every way.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> Lectures on the value of
inoculation against enteric were given to induce men to submit themselves
voluntarily to the operation; soldiers whose marksmanship was below the
average received additional instruction in musketry, and preparations were
made for the disposal of those men who were too young or not physically
fit for the campaign. In the midst of all this bustle, three officers and
sixty-seven of the other ranks were sent off to the mounted infantry at
Shorncliffe,<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> and the reservists&mdash;three sergeants, seven corporals, and two
hundred and seventy privates&mdash;arrived, who, from their age, their long
service, and the experience which many of them had gained on the north-west
frontier of India, proved invaluable in the South African war.</p>

<p>The Royal Irish, who shared the s.s. <i>Gascon</i> with the Wiltshire regiment,
embarked at Southampton with thirteen officers, one warrant officer, and
672 non-commissioned officers and men, or a total of 686 of all ranks, under
the command of Lieutenant-Colonel W. H. N. Guinness.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> To understand why
so small a number of officers started with headquarters for South Africa, the
reader must remember that before the battalion left Ireland it had furnished
a draft of men trained to mounted infantry work, who were accompanied
by three officers; during the weary weeks when it seemed probable that
the Royal Irish would remain at home as part of the garrison of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
United Kingdom, several officers had obtained staff appointments in South
Africa, or had been attached to regiments already at the seat of war, and,
as has been already mentioned, three more joined the mounted infantry
while the battalion was at Aldershot.</p>

<p>The XVIIIth sailed from England under all the depressing influences
of the “Black Week”&mdash;the disastrous seven days in which three considerable
bodies of British troops sustained severe reverses at the hands of the
Boers. General Sir Redvers Buller, then in supreme command in South
Africa, had been defeated at Colenso in his attempt to extricate the defenders
of Ladysmith from the grip of the burghers whose commandos hemmed them
in on every side. Lieutenant-General Gatacre had been heavily repulsed
at Stormberg in his attack upon one of the columns that had invaded
the north-east of Cape Colony. Lieutenant-General Lord Methuen, after
three successes in his march from the Orange river towards Kimberley,
had failed with heavy loss to dislodge Cronje from the kopjes of Magersfontein.
But though the country was profoundly depressed at the news
of these successive defeats, the spirits of the Royal Irish were as high as
ever, and even had their buoyant temperaments been influenced by the
national gloom at the time of their departure, life on board the <i>Gascon</i>
was too full of occupation to allow time for thinking of unpleasant things.
As the reservists had not joined in time to be equipped fully before they
left Aldershot, their field service kit was issued to them on the voyage;
and as many of them had not been trained to the use of the Lee-Metford
rifle, they were put through a course of musketry at sea. All hands were
daily exercised in physical drill; ammunition carriers and company scouts
were selected and given theoretical instruction in their duties; identity
cards were prepared and sewn into the men’s clothing, and wire cutters
served out. To provide healthy amusement for the troops the officers
organised “tugs-of-war” and other forms of athletics in the afternoons,
while concerts and “sing-songs” filled up the evening hours.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>When the <i>Gascon</i> reached Cape Town on the 6th of January, 1900, the
Royal Irish and the Wiltshire were ordered not to disembark, as the
destination of Clements’ brigade was still uncertain. For three days the
battalion remained inactive, with little to do but to gaze on the lovely
scenery of Table Bay; to admire the great fleet of transports and store-ships
floating on its waters, and to form some idea of the general situation at
the front. This was no easy matter, for the censorship over the South
African press was severe, and the papers in Cape Town gave much less
news of the war than those published in the United Kingdom. Gradually
the Royal Irish ascertained that the Boer leaders had not known how to
profit by their victories. The state of affairs had not altered materially
since the <i>Gascon</i> left England, and the Union Jack still waved over the
three towns to which the burghers were laying siege. The reports from
Mafeking were satisfactory, and showed a spirit of hopeful resolution,
contrasting favourably with the attitude of part of the civilian population
of Kimberley. This great mining centre was held by a force of improvised
volunteers, stiffened by half a battalion of regular infantry and a few
gunners. Its townspeople had been greatly discouraged by Methuen’s defeat
at Magersfontein; they were now beginning to feel the privations of the
siege, or rather of the investment, for in the true sense of the word
Kimberley was not besieged; and every native runner who made his way
through the enemy’s lines brought urgent appeals for immediate relief, not
only from politicians and merchants, but also from Mr Rhodes, whose influence
at the diamond fields was so commanding that he was virtually dictator
of Kimberley. In Natal the garrison of Ladysmith had just repulsed a
vigorous assault upon their southern defences; but supplies were beginning to
run short, enteric and dysentery were rampant, and privations and overwork
were beginning to tell heavily upon the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">physique</i> of Sir George White’s
troops, whose <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">morale</i>, however, hardship and fatigue had in no wise impaired.
In the field the enemy had made no more progress than in his siege operations.
No Boer commando had crossed the Tugela to harass Sir Redvers
Buller as he lay echeloned along the railway from Chieveley to the coast, and
thus he had been unmolested while preparing for his second attempt to relieve
Ladysmith&mdash;the effort which beginning on the 10th of January, 1900, ended
in failure twenty-eight days later at Vaal Kranz. In Cape Colony the
Boers had been as slothful as in Natal. Gatacre’s opponents were still
concentrated round Stormberg; the commandos which had raided across
the Orange river by the Norval’s Pont bridge were so stoutly opposed by
Lieutenant-General French that they could advance no farther than Colesberg:
Cronje, who since his victory on December 11, 1899, had remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
inactive at Magersfontein, was confronted by Methuen’s entrenchments at the
junction of the Riet and Modder rivers, and the railway between Methuen’s
camp to the bridge over the Orange river was adequately guarded. Thus
the invaders had not gained ground, and as even the most disaffected of
the Cape Dutch had no intention of breaking into open rebellion until
commandos of Transvaalers or Free Staters appeared among them, no
general rising throughout the colony had taken place; and the safety of the
railways running from the coast to our various advanced posts was not
seriously imperilled, though the protection of those lines of communication
immobilised a large number of troops.</p>

<p>Four days after the <i>Gascon</i> steamed into Table Bay, Field-Marshal Lord
Roberts arrived at Cape Town to take command of the army in South
Africa. For political reasons the disembarkation of the headquarter staff
was made the occasion for a military display; troops lined the streets, and
a company of the Royal Irish was sent on shore to form a guard of honour
at the landing-stage. A few hours later the <i>Gascon</i> sailed for Port Elizabeth,
where on January 12, 1900, the battalion landed, and was ordered to a camp
three miles from the harbour. It was so long since the XVIIIth had been on
active service that among the rank and file only the reservists, and indeed
not all of them, knew how varied and how arduous are the fatigue duties
which troops are called upon to perform in a campaign, and the first day’s
work in South Africa proved very trying to men just out from England:
in burning heat they had first to take their part in unloading the ship, then
to pack the stores and baggage on a train which stopped a mile short of
their destination; next to “off-load” the goods, and finally to carry them
by hand into the camp and there arrange them in proper order. Before
many weeks were over the young soldiers, partly by experience and partly
by the teaching of their older comrades, had learned that in war for every
day spent in fighting fifty are occupied in marching, in making entrenchments
or breast-works, in mending roads, in building bridges, in digging
waggons out of deep mud-holes, and in dragging guns up the sides of
precipitous mountains. Early on the 13th, the battalion was ordered up
country to reinforce General French, who with a column of all arms was
defending the western portion of the De Aar-Naauwpoort-Stormberg railway
which, running roughly parallel with the Orange river, links together the
various lines from the coast to the interior of the sub-continent. The
eastern part of this cross-country railway was in the hands of the enemy,
and one of the most important points left to us was Naauwpoort junction,
only thirty-three miles south of Colesberg, the little town where Schoeman,
the leader of the invaders, had taken up his quarters. He had intended
to drive the British garrison out of Naauwpoort, break up the line connecting
Cape Town with Kimberley, and then raise the standard of revolt in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
central provinces of Cape Colony; but by a series of brilliant and audacious
manœuvres French had gradually edged him back into the network of
kopjes encircling Colesberg. Now, in the middle of January, our infantry
watched the southern and western faces of this natural fortress, while our
mounted troops, widely thrust out on either flank, sought opportunities to
harass Schoeman’s communications with the Orange Free State. The railway
from Port Elizabeth to Bloemfontein, the capital of the Free State, had
been recovered to within ten miles of Colesberg; and railhead was at
Rensberg siding, where the battalion arrived on the 15th after a journey
full of novel experiences. Owing to want of rolling stock the soldiers were
conveyed, not in ordinary passenger carriages, but in open goods trucks. If
a company was lucky it travelled in empty trucks, but if there were no
“empties” available, the men had to perch on the top of loads of coal or
stores, and to cling on for dear life as the train swayed violently in
rounding sharp turnings in the line. Every bridge and every important
culvert was held by detachments of local volunteers, who as the train
approached their post emerged from their improvised shelters to beg for
newspapers, and to report that all was well. Every station was guarded
by irregular troops, and on the platforms were loyalist ladies, who enthusiastically
greeted the Royal Irish, pressing fruit, flowers, and tobacco upon
them, and begging for regimental buttons or badges as mementos of the
meeting. At every siding stood long trains, shunted to give passage to the
troops&mdash;some composed of “empties” going back to the base to refill, others
laden with supplies of every kind for the front. At long intervals there
were halts at stations to give the men time to eat the meals, for which
preparations had been made in advance by the Railway staff officers in
charge of the line; and as the troop-train gradually neared railhead it
passed several villages where French had met and beaten back the enemy
while the battalion was still upon the sea.</p>

<p>When the Royal Irish reached Rensberg they heard that they were
to reinforce the extreme right of French’s main line, then resting on Slingersfontein,
a farm ten miles south-east of Colesberg. The burghers, discovering
that this post was weakly manned, were becoming aggressive; and only a few
hours before, a detachment of New Zealand Mounted Rifles under Captain
Madock, R.A., with a handful of the Yorkshire regiment, had found very
great difficulty in beating back a determined attack upon two hills, which,
rising about four hundred feet above the plain between Slingersfontein and
the Boer positions round Colesberg, were held as outworks to the farm.
General Clements was placed in command of the Slingersfontein area, and
when on the 16th the battalion, now provided with transport waggons and
mules, arrived at his headquarters, he ordered Colonel Guinness to occupy
these kopjes as permanent detached posts. Three companies marched off to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
“Madock’s” and “New Zealand hills,” as the scenes of the previous day’s
fighting were now called; the rest of the Royal Irish went on picket; and
though the strain of work slightly diminished as the remainder of the 12th
brigade successively joined its headquarters, for the next few weeks the
battalion was on outpost for two nights out of three. As soon as Slingersfontein
was fairly safe, French used it as a pivot for the mounted troops with
whom he was trying to find and turn the enemy’s left flank, but as
to the east and south-east of Colesberg he was checked by commandos in
superior and apparently ever-increasing strength, he sought at the other end
of his line for opportunities to manœuvre the enemy still farther backwards
towards the Orange river. Before he was able to profit by the information
gained in his reconnaissances to the north of the village, he was summoned to
Cape Town by Lord Roberts, who desired to explain to him personally
the part allotted to the cavalry division in the plan of campaign, elaborated
by the Commander-in-Chief and three or four of his most trusted advisers
since their arrival in South Africa. In a regimental history it would be out
of place to describe how the main army was assembled within striking distance
of the western frontier of the Orange Free State: it is enough to say that,
thanks to the absolute secrecy maintained by the few officers who were
in Lord Roberts’ confidence, the long and difficult process was effected with
remarkable success. The troops were entrained without an idea where they
were going; the military railway officials despatched the trains in obedience
to orders they did not understand; contradictory and misleading reports
were spread broadcast over the colony in order to deceive the enemy’s spies
and sympathisers. This policy produced the desired result. The burghers,
completely puzzled by the information that reached them, failed to penetrate
the object of Lord Roberts’ movements, and beyond reinforcing the
commandos at Colesberg, made no important changes in their dispositions.</p>

<p>As the cavalry division was now required to cover the concentration of
the main army, French returned to Rensberg to superintend its transfer to
the Orange-River-Kimberley line; and on the 6th of February, after seeing
the last of his own troops quietly disappear from the neighbourhood of
Colesberg, he made over the command of the district to Clements, whom
Lord Roberts had appointed to continue the work hitherto performed by the
cavalry commander. The duty entrusted to Clements was no easy one.
The detachment left with him was weak in numbers, weaker still in mobility;
it consisted of two squadrons of regular cavalry; about 650 Australian
volunteers, many of whom had arrived in South Africa as foot soldiers;
450 regular infantry, of whom a considerable proportion were by no means
good riders; one battery of Horse, one of Field artillery, and two howitzers;
the 12th brigade of infantry and half a battalion of the Royal Berkshire
regiment. With this small force he had to maintain himself on a front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
twenty-five miles in length against a foe whose numbers were now estimated
to be between 11,000 and 12,000 men, well armed and mounted, and whose
artillery, a 40-pr., five field-guns, and five pom-poms, was by no means to be
despised. Clements carried on the system of defence devised by French.
Companies or larger detachments of infantry were posted on important
points, a mile or more apart, in rough forts built of the stones and boulders
with which the hills were strewn. Every opportunity was taken to make
these works more secure, and as the Royal Irish plied pick and shovel and
crowbar to improve their defences, careful observation was kept on the
enemy’s big gun, and whenever the 40-pr. was turned in their direction
a signal warned them to take cover instantly. Thanks to the vigilance of
their look-out men, the Royal Irish, though frequently shelled, were able
always “to go to earth” in time, and suffered no losses from the cannonade.
The front and flanks of the positions were watched by groups of sentries,
concealed from the enemy’s view and fire by sangars&mdash;the dry-stone breastworks,
of which constant use was made throughout the war. Very soon
after French’s troops had been withdrawn, the burghers discovered that
the British facing them had perceptibly diminished in strength, and at once
began a series of attempts to turn Clements’ flanks and cut off his communications
with the rest of the army. Between the 6th and the 11th there
was fighting on various parts of the line, and so many shells fell among the
tents of the Royal Irish and the Worcester that the camps were removed to
less exposed positions.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> On the 12th, both flanks were severely bombarded
and then attacked by riflemen, who succeeded in ousting the defenders of
Hobkirk’s farm, the post marking our extreme left. At the other end of the
line the half battalion of the Worcestershire, which was holding a group of
kopjes to the east of Slingersfontein, was hotly shelled, and then exposed to
a rifle-fire so heavy that after considerable loss it was unable to retain the
whole of the ground entrusted to it, though the greater part was stubbornly
and successfully defended till nightfall.</p>

<p>Clements had been obliged to throw every available man into his fighting
line, and thus, when his left was turned and his right in serious danger, he
had no reserves in hand with which to recapture the lost positions. He
decided therefore to retire, and while the troops on the flanks were still
able to hold the Boers in some degree in check, he made his preparations to
fall back on Rensberg. From details which have been preserved of the way
in which the troops were withdrawn from the right of the line, we learn
that each of the detachments, scattered over the many miles of country
comprised in the Slingersfontein area, received orders to leave its post at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
an hour timed to bring it into camp thirty minutes before the column was
to march. At about 8 <span class="fs70">P.M.</span>, after all the Kaffirs employed as bullock-drivers
had been “rounded up and placed under guard to prevent their bolting,” the
oxen were inspanned with as little noise as possible, and as each waggon was
ready it was sent off to the unit to which it was allotted. The tents were
then struck, each corps leaving a few standing to deceive the enemy, and
finally the telegraph and signalling stations were dismantled and packed up.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>
While the carts and waggons were returning to the rendezvous of the
baggage, a company of the Royal Irish was sent to reinforce a detachment
of the battalion in guarding a defile through which the column was about
to retire, and when the troops were assembled the march began. Part of
the XVIIIth, preceded by a few mounted scouts, formed the advance-guard;
then came two guns of the Royal Horse artillery, followed by the whole of
the transport vehicles and the remainder of the guns, under escort of dismounted
troops. The convoy was flanked by infantry, with supports distributed
at intervals throughout its length. The rear-guard was composed of
the rest of the foot soldiers in column of half companies at column distance,
followed by a company in extended order, and covered by the whole of the
mounted troops, widely extended. Thanks to the brilliancy of the moonlight
and to the fact that the burghers made no attempt to harass the retreat,
Clements arrived early on the 13th at Rensberg, where to his annoyance he
found that the Boers had anticipated his movements by occupying a range
of kopjes, which from the east commanded the railway from Rensberg to
Arundel, the next station southward on the line towards Naauwpoort Junction.
As the presence of the enemy among these kopjes made it impossible for him
to remain at Rensberg, the General determined to fall back on Arundel,
which he reached at 5 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span> on the 14th of February.</p>

<p>Here for a few days he stood on the defensive, his infantry holding
positions on the hills, his mounted men demonstrating vigorously on either
flank. During this time the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</i> of the Royal Irish was much the same as
that assigned to them at Slingersfontein: four companies held a large kopje
to the left rear of the village, and the remainder of the battalion was constantly
employed on outpost and on fatigues of every kind. The enemy was
by no means inactive, and on the 20th attacked Clements in front and on
both flanks, but without success; and the good fortune which had attended
the XVIIIth throughout the operations at Colesberg continued at Arundel,
for though at both places it was frequently shelled and often exposed to the
fire of long-range snipers, no casualties occurred while it was serving south
of the Orange river. In a short time Clements was reinforced by two field-batteries,
two 5-in. guns, a battalion of British militia, and a considerable
number of mounted volunteers, chiefly from Cape Colony and Australia;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
and after driving away the detachment of the enemy which was threatening
his left rear, he gradually recovered the ground he had abandoned, shelling
the Boers out of successive positions, the flanks of which he threatened with
his mounted troops. At that moment it was not part of the Commander-in-Chief’s
plan to strike hard for the Norval’s Pont bridge, so Clements’ movements
were comparatively slow, but on the 28th of February he re-occupied
Colesberg without opposition, for as the Boers had heard of Cronje’s surrender
at Paardeberg,<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> they were now falling back on the Orange river, doing as
much damage as possible to the railway in their retreat. Clements followed
them, repairing the line as he advanced; and on the 8th of March the head
of his column stood on the left bank of the river, facing a considerable
number of burghers, who from the other side of the stream exulted in the
destruction of the Norval’s Pont bridge, the three central spans of which they
had blown up. It was impossible to attempt to force the passage of the
Orange, as floods rendered it impassable for several days; the pontoon troop
did not arrive as soon as it was expected; when it did come up several of the
pontoons proved unserviceable, and it was not until the 15th that the river
was bridged by a structure, 260 yards in length, supported partly on
pontoons and partly on piers extemporised from casks. Large numbers of
the labourers employed in its construction were supplied from the ranks of
the Royal Irish. As soon as the bridge was practicable, a considerable body
of troops crossed at once and established themselves unmolested on the soil of
the Free State.</p>

<p>To those who judge of the importance of a military operation by the
length of the casualty lists, the work done by the Royal Irish and the other
units of the 12th brigade since they landed in South Africa will appear
insignificant, as between the 6th of February and the 15th of March the
total losses in Clements’ whole command only amounted to 327 killed,
wounded, and missing. Soldiers, however, will appreciate the value of the
part played in this stage of the campaign by General Clements, who, in the
words of the official historian, “had to detain the Boers at Colesberg and
prevent them from swooping upon the lines of communication south of the
Orange&mdash;a movement which, if successful, would have caused an outbreak
of active disloyalty in large districts of Cape Colony hitherto sullenly
quiescent. By maintaining himself between Rensberg and Arundel he fulfilled
his chief function, as well as the hardly less important duties of
guarding the right rear of the main army, of securing the safety of the
important railway junction of Naauwpoort, and incidentally of keeping
under his fire a body of the enemy who might otherwise have joined in
the opposition to Lord Roberts’ march.”<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>The history of the battalion for the next two months is almost devoid of
interest. The Royal Irish formed part of the column which Clements led
from the Orange river to Bloemfontein, over a vast and gently undulating
plain, dotted at rare intervals with villages whose inhabitants, professing
to be tired of the war, readily handed over to the troops a few hundred
rifles, some of modern pattern, others so obsolete as to be fit for nothing but
a museum of antiquities. On the 4th of April, the 12th brigade reached the
capital of the Free State, where it remained stationary for several weeks,
fully, though by no means agreeably, occupied in the drudgery which fell to
the lot of every soldier fated to garrison any of the towns wrested from the
enemy. There was much wood cutting: many fatigues at the railway
station: heavy guards and outposts, and frequent route marches. For men
whose drill was not perfect there were parades; and when drafts began to
arrive from home, courses of musketry and judging distance were carried out
for the benefit of the new-comers. The use of the rifle was not the only
part of a soldier’s trade in which the youngsters required training. As
they were ignorant of the art of making themselves comfortable on active
service their comrades, who had learned much since they landed at Port
Elizabeth, took this branch of their education in hand, and taught the
recruits to live together in groups of three men, dividing the work among
them: one collected fuel&mdash;<em>e.g.</em>, cow-dung or scraps of wood; the second looked
after the fire and cooked; while the third pitched the bivouac and acted as
orderly man to the little mess.</p>

<p>In May the battalion was in great strength, for although exposure, hardships,
and enteric fever had begun to take toll, the drafts had more than made
good the waste of the campaign. The deficiency of officers was a thing of the
past, for many had found their way out to South Africa within two or three
weeks of the landing of the battalion at Port Elizabeth, and others had
brought out drafts from home. In March six officers and a hundred and
ninety-six other ranks joined near Arundel; in April two officers and ninety
six men (chiefly from the militia reserve) reached Bloemfontein; and on
May 8, two large parties reported themselves to Colonel Guinness: the first
consisted of two officers and ninety-six men from the depôt; the second was a
company of volunteers&mdash;three officers and a hundred and nine other ranks
from the 5th (Irish) battalion of the King’s (Liverpool regiment). In no war
ever waged by Britain has the stream of reinforcements been so abundant, so
evenly distributed, and so well maintained as in the long struggle with the
Boer republics. The Royal Irish were not more favoured than other corps,
yet from the time the battalion landed until peace was declared no less than
1180 non-commissioned officers and men joined headquarters. The second
battalion provided 150 seasoned men from India, and eight drafts, 443 in
all, were sent out from home by the officer commanding details: the militia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
battalions of the Royal Irish territorial regiment contributed 423 (exclusive
of three officers),<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> and the Irish volunteers in Liverpool furnished a contingent
of 164 (also exclusive of five officers).</p>

<p>In years to come, when the nation has realised that for its own safety
every male citizen must be trained to arms, students of regimental history will
wonder how so many partially instructed troops found their way into the ranks
of the Royal Irish. Neither the militia nor the volunteers were liable to serve
abroad in case of war, but as has been said in <a href="#CHAPTER_X">Chapter x</a>., in the militia a
reserve of men had been established, picked for physique and character, who
in return for a small annual retaining fee had assumed the liability to serve
in time of war as regular soldiers in any part of the world. As soon as the
reserve of the regular army was called out, these men were summoned to the
depôt of their territorial regiments, and gradually sent out to the battalions in
South Africa. The militia reservists joining the Royal Irish were for the
most part hardy, though not highly trained peasants who after a short experience
in the field became very valuable soldiers. When the United
Kingdom began to understand that the campaign in South Africa was
developing into the most difficult and arduous war she had waged for nearly
a century, all branches of the Auxiliary Forces volunteered for active service.
The regiments of Yeomanry became the nucleus of the mounted force sent to
South Africa under the name of Imperial Yeomanry: many militia battalions
went out as complete units, and volunteer battalions were permitted to form
from their ranks companies of picked officers and men, whose function it was
to reinforce the infantry of the line at the seat of war. The Royal Irish
were fortunate in their volunteer company, which was well officered and
composed of men mostly Irish by descent, whose trades as engineers, boilermakers,
fitters, carpenters, and bricklayers had developed both their muscles
and their brains. The company landed on March 11, but on its way up
country, to use the slang of the South African war, it was “snaffled on the
L. of C.,” or in other words, detained at various posts on the lines of communication,
where all ranks learned so much of their duty in the field that a
week after they joined at Bloemfontein they were considered fit to take their
turn at the outposts: and in the forcing-house of active service they speedily
developed into a very useful body of men.</p>

<p>When the militia reservists and the volunteers reached Bloemfontein it
was anything but a cheerful place, for enteric still raged in the hospitals, and
the road to the cemetery was daily trodden by long processions of soldiers,
bearing on their shoulders stretchers whereon rested the bodies of the
comrades whom they were carrying to the grave. To counteract these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
depressing influences the officers organised rifle meetings, inter-company
football matches, and athletic sports of various kinds. The effect of these
amusements was good, but better still was the news that the brigade was
once more to take the field, when on the 17th of May General Clements was
ordered to entrain his command to Winburg, a little town about sixty-five
miles north-east of Bloemfontein.</p>

<p>Since the battalion had landed at Port Elizabeth the military situation
had improved marvellously. Ladysmith, Kimberley, and Mafeking had been
relieved. Lord Roberts had forced his way across the south-east of the Free
State, captured Cronje with 4000 burgers at Paardeberg on February 27, and
entered Bloemfontein on March 13, to find that the enemy had scattered
northwards before him in panic. When the burghers who faced Gatacre and
Clements in the north of Cape Colony heard of Cronje’s surrender, they fell
back into the east of the Free State, leaving rear-guards to watch the Orange
river, and if possible prevent the British from crossing it at Bethulie and
Norval’s Pont. Lord Roberts’ first care on reaching the capital of the
Free State was to join hands with Gatacre and Clements; to make himself
master of the railway from Bloemfontein to the Orange, and to secure the
waterworks on which the troops were dependent for pure water. From the
country west of the railway no serious attack was anticipated, but as there
was danger that the large number of Boers who had betaken themselves to
the mountainous regions in the east of the Free State might rally, destroy
the waterworks, and cut the railway&mdash;the line of communication with
the coast&mdash;the Commander-in-Chief sent a strong mounted flank-guard into
the hills east of the waterworks, while with smaller detachments he covered
the right or eastern side of the railway. At the end of March and beginning
of April these flank-guards were overtaken by a series of misfortunes: the
largest and most important was defeated with heavy loss at the waterworks
in an engagement known as Sannah’s Post; the second was captured at
Reddersberg; a third narrowly escaped a similar fate by a hasty and exhausting
retreat;<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> at Wepener only did we still hold our ground. Yet, though
these reverses were annoying, their effect was very transitory, for the Boers
failed to seize the opportunity of falling upon the railway, and by frittering
away their strength in an unsuccessful siege of Wepener allowed an uninterrupted
stream of supplies to reach the army at Bloemfontein. Strengthened by
large reinforcements from England and from Natal, Lord Roberts then began a
series of manœuvres by which he succeeded in pushing the enemy backwards
towards their eastern fastnesses, and at the end of April the danger to the line
of communication was so greatly diminished that he was free to resume the
main object of the campaign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>The Commander-in-Chief’s plan was as vast as it was simple. Upon
Pretoria, the capital of the Transvaal, were to converge several columns working
on a front nearly three hundred miles in length. On the extreme right
of the line, General Buller was to sweep the Boers out of the mountains of
northern Natal, where they had established themselves after they had been
obliged to abandon the siege of Ladysmith. Far away on the extreme left, a
force, based on Kimberley and commanded by Lieutenant-General Hunter,
was to relieve Mafeking and invade the Transvaal from the west. Lord
Roberts was to lead the main army along the railway from Bloemfontein to
Pretoria, with his left covered to some extent by Lieutenant-General Lord
Methuen, who was to move northwards through the west of the Free State;
his right was to be guarded by two strong columns under Lieutenant-Generals
Ian Hamilton and Colvile,<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> while to Lieutenant-General Rundle, who commanded
the recently landed 8th division and the body of South Africans
styled the Colonial division, was entrusted the duty of preventing raids upon
the railway between Bloemfontein and the Orange river by commandos from
the hilly country east of the line. The area which Rundle had to watch
has been described as “the granary and the manœuvre ground of the Orange
Free State, a region dotted with towns and villages, wealthy in crops,
and abounding in the water-courses, ridges, and kopjes on which the Boers
had fashioned their favourite tactics. Here men could both hide in safety
and subsist in ease; the harvest of the past year had been too rich for its
owners to be willing to desert their stores. The region, in short, formed an
irresistible attraction both to farmers and fighting men; and it flanked the
British communications from end to end.”<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> In a series of successful
skirmishes Rundle gradually pushed the enemy before him, and by the
middle of May his line stretched from Clocolan to Winburg. Lord Roberts
had entered Kroonstad on the 12th, and so satisfactory did the situation in
the south-east of the Free State then appear that a redistribution of the
forces was sanctioned, in the course of which the 12th brigade was ordered
from Bloemfontein to Winburg.</p>

<p>For a few days after its arrival the battalion was employed in building
sangars at various points round the town, and as no enemy appeared to test
these works many a young soldier thought that his labour had been wasted;
but this was not the case, for when at the end of August the place was
suddenly attacked, the fortifications thrown up by Clements proved of great
value in the defence, in which some of the mounted infantry of the regiment
took part. On May 26, the battalion started for the town of Senekal, now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
the advance base in the eastern Free State, and during a three days’ “trek”
realised the truth of the camp saying that the march of a British column in
South Africa could be traced by “bully-beef” tins and dead animals, for the
dreary, dusty, khaki-coloured plain was littered with empty rations cases, and
with the carcases of mules and oxen abandoned by the troops as they pressed
forward to the front. With this very uninviting piece of country the Royal
Irish were destined to make further acquaintance, as during the month of
June they furnished several strong escorts to convoys over the forty miles
of road between Senekal and the railhead at Winburg. The 12th brigade
remained nearly a month at Senekal, where the Royal Irish, who spent two
nights a-week shivering in the works round the town, became painfully
aware that though the winter days on the veld are glorious the nights are
abominably cold.</p>

<p>While the battalion was at Senekal the Free State burghers under
Christian De Wet had taken the initiative in the eastern part of their
republic: they had made prisoners of considerable detachments, captured
large and valuable convoys, and by breaking up the railway at several
points to the north of Bloemfontein had interrupted the line of communication
with Pretoria, where Lord Roberts, after occupying Johannesburg,
had hoisted the British flag on the 5th of June. Among the measures at
once taken by the Commander-in-Chief for the pacification of the Orange
Free State was the formation of strong flying columns to penetrate into
the districts in which the burghers were still in arms. One of these columns
was to be commanded by Clements, who, with his own brigade and that
of Major-General A. H. Paget (the 20th), was to march upon Bethlehem
where a considerable number of the enemy were known to be assembled.
With nearly 5000 men<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> Clements left Senekal on June 28, bound in the
first place for Lindley, a village forty miles to the north-east, where he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
was to join hands with Paget before moving towards Bethlehem. The
column marched in what the troops called “the picture-frame formation”:
half battalions in very extended order formed the front, sides, and rear of
a vast hollow square, covering two or three miles of ground, while the
mounted troops scouted widely in every direction. At Klipplaat Drift,
three miles from Senekal, the Boers opened fire upon the advance-guard
with four guns, a pom-pom, and a maxim, and made so stout an opposition
that Clements had only gained seven miles when the approach of night
obliged him to bivouac, with the enemy still in strength on his front and
flanks. Though most of the work fell on the mounted troops, part of
the Royal Irish regiment was engaged during the afternoon. A young
officer who had recently brought out a number of recruits to the battalion
thus describes his experiences in this, his first engagement: “The regiment
was the left flank-guard. It was the first time that many of us had been
in action, and we realised the truth of the saying that ‘it takes a ton of
lead to kill a man,’ for though for several hours we were under a hot rifle
fire from invisible enemies at more or less effective range, with shells falling
among us, I don’t think we lost more than one man killed.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> Our militia
reservists were splendid in their ignorance of danger. As the bullets were
whistling over their heads one of them was heard to ask his comrade whether
‘it was the birds making that noise!’ He must have been brother to the
man who, when ordered to set his sights at a prescribed range, explained
his failure to do so by saying that he ‘didn’t know figures.’”</p>

<p>Before daylight next morning the mounted troops dashed upon a ridge
about a mile and a half from the bivouac, forestalling the burghers in its
occupation. The Boers thereupon fell back in the direction of Bethlehem,
leaving a rear-guard who first harassed the troops by long-range “sniping,”
and then disputed the passage of a drift at the Zand river. In the course
of this day’s skirmishing a private in the battalion was wounded.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> After
Paget and Clements joined hands they turned towards Bethlehem, thirty
miles to the south-east of Lindley, and pushed through bodies of the enemy
who, though they appeared unwilling to commit themselves to anything
but a feeble skirmish, watched every movement with the eyes of a lynx,
determined to lose no opportunity of punishing any carelessness on our
part. Thanks to Clements’ vigilance, his column was very little harassed
on the march, but a strong flank-guard on Paget’s left was very roughly
handled: a battery was rushed, and for several minutes the guns passed
into the hands of the burghers, from whom they were rescued only after
a sharp fight.</p>

<p>Clements bivouacked on the 5th of July at Bontjeskraal, about eight
miles north-west of Bethlehem, and with a column greatly reduced in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
numbers by the absence of the Malta mounted infantry<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> and the Bedfordshire,
who by the order of the Commander-in-Chief had been sent back to
garrison the village of Lindley, he advanced early next morning through
scenery thoroughly characteristic of this part of South Africa. A broad
valley, bounded by flat-topped, square-sided kopjes bare of vegetation and
forbidding of aspect, descended by a gentle slope towards the belt of rolling
downs by which Bethlehem is encircled and commanded on every side.
As the Royal Irish, who were in advance-guard, cautiously made their way
down this valley, they caught distant glimpses of the trees and scattered
houses of the settlement, standing like an oasis of civilisation in a wilderness
of veld, while far to the south the horizon was bounded by the
mountains of the Brandwater Basin&mdash;range upon range of fantastically-shaped
peaks white with freshly fallen snow, as yet unmelted by the morning
sun. The troops had little time, however, to admire the weird beauty of
the scene, for the burghers had revealed their presence by shelling the
outposts at dawn, and as the advance-guard began to debouch it came
under fire from the position, strong by nature and improved by fortification,
where five thousand men with seven pieces of artillery awaited our
attack. From Vogelsfontein, a farm three miles north-east of the town,
their line curved outwards along the western rim of the depression in
which Bethlehem stands, and then turning sharply to the east ended at
Volhuter’s Kop, a grim pile of rocks dominating all the approaches from
the south. Before Clements allowed the advance-guard to become seriously
engaged, he sent a flag of truce to the officer in command of the burghers
to demand the instant surrender of the town, but after receiving a laconic
refusal from Christian De Wet<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> he began to carry out the scheme already
concerted with General Paget. The enemy’s flanks were first to be turned by
the mounted troops and then assaulted by the infantry; the 20th brigade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
was to carry Volhuter’s Kop on the south; the 12th brigade to make itself
master of Vogelsfontein farm on the north. The plan was a simple one,
but it miscarried, as owing to the great length of De Wet’s position, the
difficulties of the ground, and the failure of the mounted men on our
extreme left to make their way over a rocky watercourse, the movements
of the infantry were greatly delayed, and though late in the afternoon
Paget won a little ground, the 12th brigade made no material progress,
and when night put an end to the engagement neither of the enemy’s
flanks had been turned, or even threatened seriously.</p>

<p>When the 12th brigade deployed, the Royal Irish were on the right,
the Worcestershire on the left, the Wiltshire in support. About 1 <span class="fs70">P.M.</span>
the XVIIIth advanced in column of double companies, widely extended,
the leading companies each formed in two lines of skirmishers with ten
paces interval between the men and two hundred yards’ distance between
the lines. Very soon shells from guns scattered along a ridge about five
thousand yards to the eastward began to fall among them, and for a time
our artillery gave no great help, until a field-battery dashed through the
ranks, caught up half a company to serve as escort, and pushed on to a
ridge where it came into action. The burghers at once turned their pieces
against the audacious battery, and thanks to this diversion the battalion
had been able to move forward to within rifle-shot of the enemy’s trenches,
when an order brought it to a halt. For the rest of the day the Royal Irish
remained stationary, skirmishing with the enemy in their front, annoyed
by marksmen concealed in the houses of the town, and enfiladed by rifle
and maxim fire from a hill upon their right. So biting indeed was the
musketry from this hill that to escape it one of the companies was forced
to take cover in a donga, where it remained till nightfall, when the XVIIIth
was ordered to withdraw and bivouac at a farm out of range of the
enemy’s rifles. In the opinion of the rank and file the only good point
in this weary day’s work was that though the battalion had been engaged
for several hours it had only two men wounded, but the General knew
that the time had not been wasted, for he had seen so much of De Wet’s
position that he was able to recast his plans, and had now determined,
while not relaxing his efforts to turn the flanks, to deliver a crushing
blow at the centre of the Boer line, where it rested on a hill half a mile
to the north-west of Bethlehem.</p>

<p>Long before daybreak on the 7th the troops began to take their places for
the renewed attack; and the Royal Irish stumbled over the uneven surface of
the veld until they were halted at daybreak by Colonel Guinness, who pointed
out to his officers the dim outline of a kopje, just visible in the uncertain
light. This hill, he said, General Clements considered the key of the position:
it was to be taken at all cost; the Royal Irish had been selected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
to deliver the assault, and three companies of the Wiltshire regiment were to
support them in second line. As the mists of dawn gradually cleared away
the officers realised that their objective was the very hill from which their
right had been harassed by musketry on the afternoon of the 6th; they knew
that it was strongly held, for a patrol from one of their outposts, reconnoitring
it during the night, had heard the voices of many burghers talking
in the trenches; and they could see that a long slope, bare of cover and
exposed throughout to the enemy’s fire, led up to its crest, where two guns
had been posted within the last few hours. If our gunners succeeded in
beating down the defence, the hill would be comparatively easy to carry; but
if the stress of battle compelled them to turn their projectiles in another
direction, many a good soldier would fall before the day was won. As soon
as it was light enough for the artillerymen to see, the field and 5-in. guns
opened a slow, well-aimed cross-fire upon the hill, and the Royal Irish prepared
for the attack. Colonel Guinness formed his battalion in three lines:
the first consisted of B company; the second (the supports) was composed of
H, G, and C, in the order named from right to left; in the third (the reserve)
were F, E, and D companies. One company, A, which had been on outpost all
night, did not rejoin till the position was nearly won. The supports and
reserve were in lines of columns of half companies, whose extensions were not
to exceed three paces. Before 7 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span> the scouts of B company became warmly
engaged with the burghers, who could be seen in strength upon the hill;
Captain Daniell reinforced them with half his company (H), and then for a
long time a fierce fire-fight raged, the Boers trying to crush B company with
musketry and shrapnel, while Daniell’s men kept up a vigorous fusilade
to cover the supporting companies, which were gradually making their way
into the front line. D company ranged up on the left, the volunteers on the
right; while still farther to the right G company came into action, firing
heavy volleys. The expenditure of cartridges was great, and during this
phase of the combat the pouches of D company were replenished at least
four times by the ammunition carriers, who, to quote from Captain Daniell’s
diary, “walked about, backwards and forwards, up and down the firing line
without the slightest fear. I specially noticed a lad named Hanrehan and
Lance-Corporal Ryan, the company tailor.” Whenever the officer commanding
a company considered it was possible to push on, the subaltern or sergeant in
charge of each section selected two soldiers, who dashed forward for about
thirty yards, and then dropping on the ground covered the advance of their
comrades with their shots. Then followed another pair, and yet another, until
the whole of the section was in its new position, when its commander, who had
superintended the movement, in his turn dashed over the bullet-swept ground.
Troops less highly trained, less perfectly disciplined than the Royal Irish, would
have required an officer to head them in these rushes, but the men of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
XVIIIth could be trusted to advance and to carry out their orders without
such leading; the difficulty was not to get them to go on, but to prevent their
going on too fast and too far. Whenever the ground was favourable the
companies were “pulled together” and steadied, to prepare them for the next
rush. A sergeant in the Royal Irish thus describes his impressions of</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“the first fair stand-up fight the regiment had been in during the
war. We advanced to a real attack such as you read about in textbooks,
over comparatively level ground affording scarcely any cover, and
with due attention to intervals between individuals and firing line,
supports, and so forth. A very frosty morning, bright and bracing;
a steady controlled fire to greet us as we deployed for attack; a G.O.C.
implicitly believed in by every man in the battalion; a C.O. who possessed
every one’s confidence; and officers in front (too much so indeed)
to lead the way&mdash;such were our surroundings. In the ranks one cannot
see much in a general engagement, but I have a distinct recollection
of there being a total lack of confusion during the action: signals,
words of command, were quickly responded to; the passing of orders
was rapidly carried out; volunteers for every purpose were numerous;
wounded men were instantly cared for and taken back to the dressing-station
by the stretcher-bearers.”</p></div>

<p>The battalion gained ground, but not rapidly, for the opposition was
considerable and the firing line had been again reinforced, when just as the
leading men had reached a belt of burned grass, on which their khaki
clothing was unpleasantly conspicuous, they were brought to a sudden halt
by a donga&mdash;a natural moat protecting the part of the hill on which the
enemy’s guns were posted. As this donga was impassable, the only thing to do
was to turn it; and each company successively moved off to the right in perfect
order, circled round the head of the obstacle, and then re-formed in the
required direction as steadily as though on parade in a barrack square. At
this moment our bombardment swelled into a violent cannonade. Our musketry
had already made itself felt among the defenders of the hill, and when
the shells began to rain upon them, the burghers, who, in the words of an
artillery officer, “had hitherto stuck to their work like men,” lost heart, and
gradually quitted their trenches, leaving to a few of their gunners the task of
saving the guns. These gallant fellows succeeded in getting one away in
safety, and did not cease their efforts to remove the other until a mass of
Royal Irish, yelling like demons and with bayonets fixed, were within a
couple of hundred yards of them. Then they turned and fled for their
lives, and the gun, one of the 15-prs. lost by the 77th battery at Stormberg,
once more passed into the hands of its lawful owners. While part of the
battalion established itself on the crest of the hill, where a long line of
trenches, cut deep into the rock, showed how diligently the Boers had
fortified this part of the position, the remainder was held in readiness to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
push forward into the town. But with the capture of the hill the engagement
virtually ended; Paget, with the help of two companies of the Royal
Irish, made himself master of Volhuter’s Kop almost without loss: Vogelsfontein
was occupied without resistance, and the burghers streamed away
in full retreat, followed only by the shells of the artillery, for the mounted
troops (chiefly Imperial Yeomen and Australian Rifles) were still too new
to their work to be launched in pursuit of an enemy who never proved more
formidable than in a rear-guard action. The comparative ease with which
the Boers were driven out of Bethlehem was owing to the fact that De Wet
had learned that a column of British under General Hunter was moving down
on him from the north;<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> as he felt unable to make head against this
reinforcement, he had only fought to gain time for his main body to join
the large number of Free Staters, who from behind the Wittebergen range
faced General Rundle and the 8th division. To this is due the small number
of casualties on the 6th and 7th of July, together amounting only to
a hundred and six killed and wounded&mdash;a total to which the Royal Irish
contributed almost half. Among the officers Captain J. B. S. Alderson was
mortally, and Captain T. Warwick-Williams (volunteer company) slightly,
wounded; of the other ranks, two were killed, four died of their injuries,
and forty-seven were wounded.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p>As soon as the engagement was over the troops were allowed to fall out
and cook their food; fires sprang up everywhere, and while some of the
men made porridge from meal found in a neighbouring farm, others tried
to convert the burghers’ pigs into pork. An officer thus describes the
scene: “One of the volunteers pursued a very old beast with a field-telegraph
pole poised above his head; when he got within striking distance
he brought it down with a crash, but of course by the time it reached the
ground the pig was well away. Then up galloped one of Brabant’s
Horse, who with bayonet fixed tried to use his rifle as a hog-spear;
he lunged at the pig, missed it, buried his bayonet in the ground, and
came a lovely cropper off his horse. This old pig was a wary brute,
and after running many risks, escaped unhurt.” In the course of the afternoon
some of the officers of the battalion were allowed to visit Bethlehem,
which they found no better and no worse than the other towns in
the Free State. In this part of South Africa every settlement had the
same general characteristics. In the middle of an unpaved, undrained, and
evil-smelling market square was a large church, built at the expense
of the congregation by an architect who apparently took a barn as
his model of ecclesiastical architecture. The square was fringed with the
most important buildings in the place&mdash;the government offices, the bank, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
stores, and the hotels&mdash;not standing side by side, but apparently dropped
down from the sky at random, with great gaps between them, where
loose cattle roamed at will. The dwelling-houses were scattered along
the roads leading from the church to the open veld. Those belonging to
British traders and to burghers who had acquired a veneer of European
civilisation stood in pretty gardens, gay with flowers and planted with
trees, and looked like small “villa residences” transported from a London
suburb to the wilds of South Africa. The abodes of the old-fashioned
Boers, on the other hand, were nothing but cottages built of sun-dried
bricks, without a tree, a flower, or a blade of grass to mitigate their
hideousness.</p>

<p>A few hours after the occupation of Bethlehem General Clements
issued this general order:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The G.O.C. wishes to congratulate the force under his command
on the way in which it has acquitted itself during a trying time since
it marched from Senekal. The mounted troops had very hard work,
and have seen a good deal of fighting. The artillery have performed
most excellent work and made excellent practice. The infantry have
had hard work, continuous marching, and done excellently while in
contact with the enemy. The Royal Irish regiment particularly distinguished
itself to-day. To one and all the thanks of the G.O.C.
are due, and he has the utmost confidence that the 12th brigade force
as now constituted will continue to maintain the high reputation it
has already won.”</p></div>

LYDENBURG: THE MOUNTED INFANTRY OF THE ROYAL IRISH REGIMENT.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">Two days after Bethlehem was taken, General Hunter’s column entered the
town, and Clements fell back towards Senekal to obtain the supplies of
which his men were much in need. After a week’s halt at Biddulphsberg,
the 12th brigade was recalled by General Hunter, now in command
of the whole of the troops in the eastern Free State, to take part in a
great combined movement against the burghers who had retired into the
hilly region drained by the river Brandwater, and locally known as the
Brandwater Basin. It is bounded on the south by the river Caledon, the
frontier of the native state of Basutoland, whose savage warriors, longing
for a pretext to attack their hereditary enemies the Boers, stood ready to
resist any violation of their territory, and thus forbade the passage of the
stream. To the west, north, and east the basin is enclosed by high, almost
continuous ranges, which, springing from the right bank of the Caledon,
form a huge horse-shoe, whose northern foot-hills sink into the plain a few
miles south of Bethlehem. This mountain wall is about seventy miles in
perimeter, and is crossed at five places by roads fit for wheeled traffic: the
western face (the Wittebergen) is pierced by Commando Nek, the northern
by Slabbert’s and Retief’s Neks, the eastern (the Roodebergen) by Naauwpoort
Nek and the Golden Gate. Very soon after Hunter arrived at Bethlehem, he
decided to fight his way with part of his force into the Brandwater Basin
from the north and west, and to drive the burghers into the arms of detachments
posted at the mouths of Naauwpoort Nek and Golden Gate: but
before this plan could be carried into effect he had to wait for supplies of
food and ammunition, and it was not until a fortnight after the occupation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
Bethlehem that his troops were ready to begin work. On July 21st, his army
was thus distributed: Rundle with the 8th and Colonial divisions stretched
from Ficksburg to Senekal; the brigades of Clements and Paget lay at Wit
Kop and Witnek, a few miles north-west of Slabbert’s Nek; the Highland
brigade (the 3rd, under Major-General MacDonald), stood at Bethlehem ready
to march on Retief’s Nek; and Major-General Bruce-Hamilton with the 12th
brigade, to which part of the Royal Irish mounted infantry had been attached,
commanded the exit from Naauwpoort Nek. Next day orders were issued
for a general attack along the whole of the western and northern line; Rundle
was to bombard Commando Nek, while Clements and MacDonald assaulted
Slabbert’s Nek and Retief’s Nek respectively. Clements advanced on the
22nd to Bester’s Kop, the enemy’s outposts retiring before him towards
Slabbert’s Nek. He had only two of his four battalions at that moment
with him, for the Worcestershire had been temporarily detached, and the
Bedfordshire had not rejoined from Lindley.</p>

<p>During the night, the draft of ninety-eight non-commissioned officers
and men, with whom Major Lysaght had joined the battalion on the
18th, had a rough introduction to the joys of campaigning in South
Africa: there was a great storm; rain fell in torrents; many of the
horses broke loose and stampeded in every direction, and when the Royal
Irish fell in after a hurried meal of sodden biscuit and bully beef, they
were wet to the skin, and longed for the excitement of a fight to get
their blood once more in circulation. But the General’s plans had been kept
secret, and the Royal Irish, who were in advance-guard, had no idea that an
action was imminent, and trudged wearily over the rough surface of the
rolling down, scarcely glancing at the curious line of isolated kopjes which,
at intervals of a mile or more, rose like watch towers across their path.
Suddenly distant firing was heard; at the sound of the guns the XVIIIth
stepped out vigorously, and soon discovered that Brabant’s Horse, the cavalry
screen to the column, were being shelled by the defenders of Slabbert’s Nek.
As Clements reconnoitred this formidable position, he found that its difficulties
had not been exaggerated by his guides&mdash;loyal Britons settled in the
Free State, who at the outbreak of the war had placed their local knowledge
at the disposal of the Intelligence department. The Nek, or pass, ran through
a defile about half a mile in width, overhung by steep, almost precipitous
mountains, and its entrance was partially barred by a low rounded knoll,
with smooth glacis-like sides, seamed with trenches which swept the ground
to the front and flanks. To the left of the defile, as he looked at it, was a
long square-topped kopje, with cliff-like walls that only a goat could climb:
to the right stretched another kopje, higher, longer, and more irregular in
shape, with five great spurs projecting from its rugged flank. Above these
spurs rose a series of ledges, like the steps of a gigantic staircase; the hillside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
was strewn with boulders and honeycombed with caves, and the topmost
peak raised its snowy crest nearly two thousand feet above the plain. The
greater part of this kopje was held by the left wing of the enemy, and
Clements realised that until he had taken it he could not hope to force the
pass; therefore, as soon as his flanks were covered by mounted troops, and
his artillery had begun to shell the trenches on the Nek, he directed Lieutenant-Colonel
Grenfell, with part of his corps (the 1st Brabant’s Horse) and
a few Imperial Yeomanry, to seize one of the projecting spurs. This mission
the irregulars fulfilled, but when they began to scale the ledges they were
brought to a standstill by a furious burst of musketry; the General at once
ordered two companies of the Wiltshire to occupy a spur on the right of
that ascended by Brabant’s Horse, and directed the Colonel of the Royal Irish,
who were then about five thousand yards from Grenfell’s spur, to send two
companies to reinforce the dismounted troopers. The choice fell on G
(Captain Gloster) and H (Captain Daniell), the former being in command of
the whole detachment.</p>

<p>After a stiff climb, H company joined Grenfell on one of the ledges or
steps in the kopje, where they found Brabant’s Horse hotly engaged with the
burghers, who held two tiers of rocks, the lower four or five hundred yards
up the hillside, the higher about two hundred yards farther off; another
body of the enemy enfiladed the ledge from a donga. In an hour or two
Gloster joined Daniell, prolonging the line to the left, where, to quote from a
letter of Lieutenant Kelly, a subaltern in G company, “we fired wildly at
where we thought the enemy were, for we could not see a man, but had a
good idea, as they were shooting uncommonly straight. Brabant’s were on
the same ledge with us, and a real cheery lot they were&mdash;quite delighted with
everything and full of jokes.” Just after the Royal Irish had snatched a
mouthful of food, a message arrived from the General, “as soon as you have
occupied the spur, send two companies to the top of the hill.” Gloster and
Daniell reconnoitred the ground, and decided to “rush” the next belt of
rocks, Gloster working up to them from the right, while Daniell made a
dash across the open. After sending for ammunition and filling the men’s
pouches, Gloster moved forward with half his company, leaving Kelly with
the remainder of G company to support his advance with musketry. Following
the plan made by the two captains, Daniell gave Gloster about ten
minutes’ start, and then pushed on from both flanks, but though Kelly kept
up a vigorous fusilade upon the ridge of rocks, the immediate object of the
combined attack, the enemy was unshaken, and the bullets fell like hail
among the men of H company as they ran up the slope. Suddenly Gloster’s
half company began to appear on the right, moving in such a way as to
come under the musketry of Kelly’s party, who from their position could
not see Gloster’s men; the danger was so imminent that Daniell himself ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
back across the fire-swept zone and ordered Kelly to follow him to the ridge,
now held by the leading troops. When they reached the front line they
found that Gloster, mortally wounded, was sinking rapidly. Again to quote
his subaltern: “he had reached the top quite under cover, and in his usual
dashing manner was pushing forward in front. He climbed up and looked
over a rock; and seeing some Dutchmen quite close, raised his rifle, and as he
did so was shot, as was another man in exactly the same way. The bullet
passed through the right fore-arm and chest. He was a really gallant fellow,
and died nobly.” When Daniell thus succeeded to the command of the
detachment, the situation was very unpleasant. The ledge upon which the
men crouched was so commanded by the enemy’s fire that every time a
soldier peered over it he drew a storm of bullets: and on the left front the
burghers seemed to be in force within twenty or thirty yards of our position.
The men were anxious to avenge Gloster’s death with the bayonet, but a
charge was impossible, for it could only have been delivered on a very narrow
front and under converging fire. There was nothing for it but to lie under
the crest of the ridge, to keep the men on the alert by shooting at the rocks
behind which the Boers were ensconced, and to report by signal that any
farther advance would be attended by very serious risk. Fortunately,
cartridges never ran short, as the ammunition carriers were able to reach the
firing line under cover from the left rear, where Lieutenant Panter-Downes
with a few men showed so determined a front that he kept the burghers at a
respectful distance, and prevented them from enfilading Daniell’s party.</p>

<p>While Gloster’s detachment was struggling for foothold on the hill the
battalion marched towards the foot of Grenfell’s spur; on the way two companies
(D under Captain Milner and F under Captain White) were diverted
to the left front to watch the burghers in the trenches on the pass. The
plain that these companies had to cross looked perfectly level from a
distance, but in reality was a series of undulations over which without a
landmark it was difficult to move in the right direction. Such a landmark
was found in a cluster of Kaffir huts, but the Boers had taken the range
accurately, and when D company passed between the kraals it was greeted
by a storm of bullets, by one of which Captain Milner was dangerously
wounded. Neither company halted until it was about nine hundred yards
from the works on Slabbert’s Nek, with whose defenders for the rest of the
day they exchanged a slow but steady fire; and from the right of D’s line
the Boers who were facing Gloster’s party could be plainly seen; “but,”
writes an eye-witness, “we did not dare to shoot much at them, as they were
too much mixed up with our men.”</p>

<p>As two companies were acting as escort to the guns, the main body
of the XVIIIth was now reduced to two companies of regular soldiers and
one of volunteers. This skeleton battalion was finally halted about eighteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
hundred yards to the left rear of Grenfell’s spur, and in widely extended lines,
lay for many hours exposed to the shots of marksmen, who were so well
concealed that they offered a very poor target in return. The headquarter
companies of the Royal Irish had nothing to do except to fire an occasional
round in the direction from which the enemy’s bullets came; to listen to the
bursts of musketry from the hill, and to wonder how long the shells of a
pom-pom playing on them from the Nek would continue to fall among the
regiment without doing any harm. Happily only one of these horrible little
projectiles found a billet: it shattered the big drum, greatly to the amusement
of every one, except the drummer, who was fast asleep beside it. The
damage to the drum was soon avenged by a 5-in. shell, which smashed the
pom-pom and blew several Boer gunners to pieces.</p>

<p>When darkness put an end to the combat, the result of the day’s operations
seemed meagre in the extreme. Brabant’s Horse and Gloster’s detachment of
the Royal Irish had doubtless made a lodgment on the hill to the right of the
pass; but they could do no more than hold their ground, and could expect no
help from the two companies of the Wiltshire, who had failed to establish
themselves on the spur which they had been ordered to seize. The works on
the Nek had been vigorously bombarded, but their defenders appeared to be
unshaken by the shells of the artillery and the threatening presence of Paget’s
brigade on the left of the guns. But the General was in no way dispirited,
for excellent news had reached him in the afternoon. An officer of Brabant’s
Horse, who with a small party of mounted men was watching the outer flank
of the big kopje, heard that Grenfell and Gloster were “held-up” on the
ledges, and determined to ascertain if there was no other way to the top
of the hill. By “a most daring and successful reconnaissance” on foot, he
discovered a track leading to the summit, running well to the right of the
ledges, through ground apparently unoccupied by the enemy. When Clements
received this report he saw that once he had gained possession of the top, he
could outflank the burghers facing Brabant’s Horse and the Royal Irish, drive
them before him into the Nek, and then rake its defences with rifle-fire. As
it was then too late to attempt any important movement, he ordered a
squadron of Brabant’s (dismounted) to be at the summit by daybreak next
morning, promising them the support of four companies of the Royal Irish
and two of the Wiltshire regiment, who were not to follow the path discovered
by the officer of Brabant’s, but to ascend by a ridge still farther to the right.
While most of the infantry bivouacked on the ground they stood on, four
companies of the Royal Irish were assembled, and moved to the farmhouse
fixed as the rendezvous of the little column. At 4 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span> on the 24th Lieutenant-Colonel
Guinness, who commanded the combined force, began to ascend the
kopje, described by General Clements as “an almost unclimbable hill”;
four hours’ desperate scrambling brought the Royal Irish, breathless and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
exhausted, to its highest crest, where they found the dismounted troopers of
Brabant’s Horse, who moving by a shorter and easier route had gained the
summit some little time before their comrades of the XVIIIth. Hitherto the
march had been unopposed, but now a few shots were fired by burghers who
appeared more anxious to retire than to fight. Part of the infantry then
joined hands with G and H companies whose adventures during the night
will be told later; the remainder drove the enemy before them, turned the
works upon the Nek, and swept them with musketry from the left rear. A
great burst of cheering greeted the appearance of the Royal Irish on the top
of the hill; a general advance was ordered; the Boer resistance suddenly
collapsed, and by 11 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span> Clements was master of Slabbert’s Nek.</p>

<p>An officer has supplied the author with a very spirited account of the
proceedings of the headquarter companies, from which the following extracts
have been taken:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We arrived at the farm about 7 or 8 <span class="fs70">P.M.</span> on the 23rd, without
transport, and consequently without blankets or food, on the coldest
night I remember having spent during the war. After seeing the men
settled and giving them leave to break open their emergency rations, we
went into the farm building. Here the Wiltshire officers who had arrived
before us, had already made themselves comfortable before a fire in the
kitchen, and had a chicken roasting for their breakfast. There were six
of us, and we had had nothing inside us since dawn&mdash;hence lowering of
the moral sense and theft! We had only two emergency rations among
us: we ate them: they were excellent, but not enough, and we eyed that
bird hungrily until the Wilts nodded: then some one suggested the eating
of that chicken. We needed very little persuasion to tear it limb from
limb, and we devoured it hastily, like house-breakers at supper in a
burgled house! The anger of the Wilts was great when a couple of
hours later they awoke; they did not suspect us at the time, thinking we
had been all asleep, and their wrath was directed against the men. So
warped had our sense of right and wrong become that it was not until
we had dined them next day in camp that we gave ourselves away....
After a few hours’ sleep we&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>, A, D, F, and the volunteers, and two
companies of the Wiltshire, started on our night march, led by Colonel
Guinness and a guide, and a more miserable time we never had. It was
bitterly cold, with a Scotch mist blowing sharply down from the hill
above us. The necessity for secrecy forbade our smoking, and the effort
to keep from coughing, kicking down stones, and otherwise making a
noise was very trying. The track lay up a ‘razor-edge’ sort of ridge,
very slippery and strewn with boulders. The higher we climbed the
more difficult it became, until finally we were ‘clawing up’ on hands and
knees, and the last bit, just as there was a glimmer of light, was the
worst of all: we had to pull each other up by our rifles, yet, with
precipitous ground all around us, we lost not a man.”</p></div>

<p>The column had now reached the shoulder of the kopje, and rested on the
snow-covered ground for a short time while Colonel Guinness and the guide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
looked for a path towards the top. The path, when found, proved to be a
mere goat-track, on a narrow ledge with a wall of rock on the right hand
and a precipice on the left. On this track there was only room to walk in
Indian file, and</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“we were about half-way across this bit when the fog lifted a little and
showed us what a giddy path we were following. It also showed us a
few slouch-hatted figures on a spur below us. I can tell you we company
officers were fairly alarmed, caught as we were in a place where movement
of any sort, except fore or aft, was impossible, so it was to our
great relief that we discovered these men to be a handful of Brabant’s
scouts. A few shots were fired at us at about 8 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span> when we got to the
real top of the hill, by a few Boers, some on a knoll below us and others
to our front, but these men soon cleared out. The fog was now lifting
rapidly and the sun came out as we advanced down into position on the
knoll overlooking the Nek itself and the Boer line of retreat. Heavy
firing had been going on since dawn, down where the rest of the brigade
was, and across the valley where Paget’s brigade was also trying to force
the pass. For some time we saw nothing, then a few small mounted
parties of Boers were seen riding off towards Fouriesberg. We opened
fire, the range I think being about a thousand yards. This was the
signal for a regular bolt of the whole Boer force. We fired rapidly on
them, but I don’t know if we did much execution firing at such a steep
angle downwards. Our right was hurried forward down the hill, but the
steepness and difficulty of the ground prevented our getting much closer.
By the time we had got well down, practically all the Boers had cleared
out. It was wonderful to see how the men bucked up. Before the firing
began they were moving about like a lot of cripples, ‘dead to the world,’
and anxious only to get a few minutes to sit down and sleep in. The
moment they realised what was going on, all this was thrown off and they
were as happy and as energetic as a parcel of schoolboys.”</p></div>

<p>While the headquarter companies of the battalion were doing this fine
piece of rock climbing, G and H were clinging to their ground with the
utmost determination. As soon as it became dark Daniell had posted the men
with him, about a hundred of all ranks, along the ridge in little detachments
of three or four; in front of each post lay a sentry, flat on his stomach,
peering over the rocks to watch the movements of the enemy. Up to midnight
the Boers “sniped” assiduously; then the fire died away, and Daniell and
Kelly moved constantly up and down the line to make sure that the soldiers,
lulled by the sudden silence and exhausted by hunger and fatigue, had not
fallen asleep. About 4 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span> on the 24th, Panter-Downes brought up the
remainder of H company: while this welcome reinforcement was being posted
there was an alarm, caused by the approach of a number of Kaffirs whom the
Boers had sent to reconnoitre the position: the men promptly lined the top of
the ridge, and speedily gave the burghers to understand that the Royal Irish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
were quite ready to receive them! When day broke, says one of the officers
who was present&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“we quickly found out that the enemy were still there, but they had left
the rocks on our left, so we occupied them. They ‘hotted’ us for a bit, but
as soon as the companies appeared on the top of the mountain they began
to disperse. The guns kept up a hot bombardment, and very soon we
could see the enemy beating a retreat all round. We sent down for
water and food, made ourselves comfortable, and watched the enemy
retire. Brabant’s brought up our gun and the Hotchkiss, and made some
splendid practice among the Boers as they left a hill, and we saw a good
many of them knocked over.... We received tremendous congratulations
for our part in the battle, especially the charge up the hill....
We buried poor Gloster and five men by a tree at the foot of the
hill.”<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p></div>

<p>The capture of Slabbert’s Nek cost only forty-four casualties, of which
many occurred among the Royal Irish. Captain W. Gloster was killed;
Captain E. F. Milner was dangerously wounded; six of the other ranks were
killed, and ten wounded, three of whom died of their injuries.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>In General Clements’ report of July 26, he gave high praise to the
1st battalion, Royal Irish regiment, in these terms&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Lieutenant-Colonel H. W. N. Guinness has again proved himself a
commanding officer of the first class. His battalion has throughout
proved itself to be all that could be desired on service. His leading of a
force on the 24th of July over an almost unclimbable hill, and by this
means turning the enemy’s position at Slabbert’s Nek, is deserving of
special mention.</p>

<p>“Captain W. Gloster, who I regret to say was killed while leading
his company at Slabbert’s Nek on the 23rd of July, was an officer of
great promise. By his death the Service loses a most valuable company
leader.</p>

<p>“Captain E. H. Daniell has proved himself a first-rate company leader
in difficult circumstances by the handling of his men on the 23rd and
24th of July, on both of which dates he showed great gallantry.</p>

<p>“Lieutenant J. A. M. J. P. Kelly did particularly good service on the
night of the 23rd of July, in leading his men over an open space, 300 yards
wide, swept by a heavy cross-fire, and maintaining his position all night
at close quarters (20 yards) from the enemy who were holding the rocks
and caves in his front.”</p></div>

<p>In the same report General Clements stated that Major K. P. Apthorp,
who was temporarily employed as an intelligence officer on his staff, had
afforded him “very great help until taken prisoner on June 6.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>The following non-commissioned officers and private soldiers were also
mentioned:&mdash;</p>

<p>No. 4512, Lance-Corporal P. Doyle;<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> No. 4248, Lance-Corporal M.
Tytherleigh; No. 4868, Lance-Corporal J. Rathbone; No. 1408, Private &mdash;&mdash;
Baker; No. 4129, Private &mdash;&mdash; Ryan; and No. 5024, Private P. Dumphy,
particularly distinguished themselves on the night of July 23. No. 4506,
Private J. Kavanagh, who showed remarkable courage and coolness on the
same occasion, was wounded while carrying a message across ground heavily
swept by fire.</p>

<p>As soon as General Clements learned that the Highland brigade had
driven the Boers from Retief’s Nek, he marched two or three miles along
the road to Fouriesburg, the chief town in the Brandwater Basin, and
then encamped. The halt was very welcome; an officer writes, “we were
all very much done up, especially those who had been in Colonel Guinness’s
night march, and after a good ‘square’ meal and a double issue of rum
(Reger, our Quartermaster, surpassed himself on this occasion) there were
few of us awake that afternoon.” Next day the whole of Hunter’s army
was in motion. MacDonald was sent to help Bruce Hamilton in the task
of sealing the mouths of Naauwpoort Nek and the Golden Gate, the passes
by which the Boers might dash eastward into the open country round
Harrismith, the principal town in that part of the Free State. Clements
and Paget marched through a fertile country, well watered and full of
prosperous farms, towards Fouriesburg, whither Rundle, who had dislodged
the burghers from Commando Nek, was also hastening. As the advance-guard
of the 8th division was the first to reach the goal, Clements’ and
Paget’s brigades were halted a few miles from Fouriesburg, and did not move
again until the 27th, when they entered the place after a feeble opposition
from a few snipers dropped by the main body of the enemy who, still
ignorant that British troops awaited them at the eastern passes, were
retreating at speed towards Naauwpoort Nek and the Golden Gate. But
though most of the burghers were hurrying eastward, it was necessary
to ensure that no detachments should break out through Slabbert’s, Retief’s,
or Commando Neks, and so heavy was the call upon the infantry to garrison
these defiles that Hunter could only muster five battalions to drive the
Boers into the net spread by MacDonald and Bruce Hamilton. One of
these was the 1st battalion, Royal Irish regiment, which with part of the
Wiltshire formed the advance-guard under Clements on the 28th, when
the burghers fought a rear-guard action near Slaap Kranz ridge with
great tenacity and cunning. The position proved to be a very strong one,
and Clements was unable to oust the enemy from it, though his artillery
and infantry were engaged throughout the day. Colonel Guinness was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
anxious to be allowed to seize a commanding knoll in front of the left
of the Boer line, which seemed to offer a good base for an assault upon
the pass itself, but General Clements considered that the Royal Irish had
done enough for the day, and ordered a battalion of the Scots Guards,
recently arrived on the field, to occupy it. At midnight they advanced
on the main position and found it undefended, for the Boers, after checking
the whole column for many hours, had silently disappeared when they
saw that the odds had become too heavy for them to face. The casualties
of the day amounted to thirty-four killed and wounded, the Royal Irish
losing one man killed and five wounded.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>With the encounter at Slaap Kranz the campaign in the Brandwater Basin
came to an end. De Wet had always opposed the policy of retreating into
the mountains of Fouriesburg, but his views had been over-ridden, and,
as mentioned on <a href="#Page_330">page 330</a>, he had fought Clements at Bethlehem to gain
time for the main body to complete its concentration in the valley of
the Brandwater. When he arrived there with his rear-guard, he set himself
to convince the members of his very unruly army that the fastnesses to
which they had betaken themselves would prove not a sanctuary but a
trap, and urged them to follow him in a bold dash into the open veld.
His rough eloquence appeared to convince the majority; his scheme for
breaking out of the mountains was accepted, and on the night of July 15,
he made his way with two thousand six hundred men across Slabbert’s
Nek, and headed northwards, in the full belief that within twenty-four
hours the remainder of the burghers would follow him. But as soon as
De Wet’s commanding personality was removed the Free Staters fell into
confusion; instead of carrying out the plan to which they had agreed
they began to quarrel among themselves; they lost precious days in wrangling
over the choice of another leader, and by the time that Hunter’s columns
were advancing upon the passes they had become demoralised, suspicious
of their chiefs and of each other. Dry rot spread so rapidly among them
that on the 30th, Prinsloo, who claimed to have been elected General-in-Chief,
surrendered with 4140 men, three guns (two of which had been
lost by the Royal Horse artillery at Sannah’s Post), 4000 horses and
ponies, many waggons, a large number of rifles, and a million rounds of
small-arm ammunition.</p>

<p>The Royal Irish saw enough of the prisoners to form an idea of the
manner of men with whom they had been fighting since the beginning
of the year. The first impression was one of utter astonishment. Was it
possible that this motley crowd of civilians formed part of the burgher
levies which for many months had constantly opposed and frequently defeated
the British army? Some were old men with long white beards; others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
were in the prime of life; others, again, were lads not half-way through
their teens; none wore a vestige of uniform, and the majority were dressed
in clothes so badly cut that no self-respecting peasant in Europe would
have condescended to wear them. Yet among the captives every grade of
society in the Free State republic was represented: there were land-owners,
who possessed tens of thousands of acres and great wealth of flocks
and herds; members of Parliament; civil servants; merchants; lawyers;
doctors; and last, but by no means least in numbers, “bywohners,” or poor
Boers, who, as they had no land of their own, were allowed to squat on
the estates of their richer neighbours. The land-owning class, as a rule,
were magnificent men, well-grown, sturdy, and inured to hardships; constant
hunting on their farms had made them good rifle shots and excellent judges
of distance,<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> and, as has already been mentioned, many of them had served
in campaigns against the Kaffirs. In character they much resembled the
British yeomen of two hundred years ago, for although brave, patriotic, and
hospitable, they were ignorant, obstinate, and deeply distrustful of new
men and new ideas. A certain number of the professional classes had
been sent in their youth to Europe to complete their education; their
travels had greatly widened their intellectual horizon, and as they did not
stay away long enough to lose their sporting tastes or their hereditary
instinct for irregular warfare, they proved a valuable asset in the Boer
army. In dress as well as education these younger men presented a
curious contrast to their fellow-citizens, who were still as uncouth in speech
and manners as the original pioneers of the Free State, while the Europeanised
burghers were dressed in well-cut Norfolk jackets, boots, and breeches, and
spoke English admirably with accents acquired at the Universities of Oxford,
Edinburgh, or Glasgow. The very baggage owned by the prisoners when
they surrendered showed how wide a difference there was between the
old school and the new. The old-fashioned burghers, however rich they
were, had gone on active service with their few belongings packed in
old and shapeless carpet-bags; the youngsters took the field with kit-bags
or suit-cases imported from England.</p>

<p>General Hunter’s success in the Brandwater Basin, to which the Royal
Irish contributed not a little, was far-reaching in its results; in the words
of the official historian “it removed in a moment the possibility of attack
in force from the west, which had kept Sir Redvers Buller’s army chained
fast to the railway from Heidelberg down to Ladysmith. True, De Wet,
Olivier, and other guerillas were still at large, but, vagrant and weakened,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
they were unlikely seriously to raid Natal across the Drakensberg, an
eventuality which had never been absent, and with reason, from Sir R.
Buller’s mind. None had known better than he how vulnerable still that
many-gated colony was to incursions which would have undone in a few
hours the heavy work of months.”<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> Now General Buller was able to
organise a mobile force to march northwards against the Pretoria-Komati
Poort railway in order to co-operate with Lord Roberts in the invasion
of the Eastern Transvaal, where the remnants of the Boer army still kept
the field. In this great movement the Royal Irish were destined to play
their part, for on the 1st of August Clements’ brigade left Hunter’s army;
on the 9th it marched into Kroonstad, and after many halts and delays on
the railway reached Pretoria on the 18th. It was one of the peculiarities
of the war in South Africa that no General could hope to keep his brigade
intact for any length of time; so far Clements had been fortunate, but
now his turn for dismemberment arrived, and after bidding farewell to
the commander whom they admired and respected deeply, the Royal Irish
were sent off to Belfast, a station on the Komati Poort line, where they
joined Major-General Smith-Dorrien’s brigade (the 19th) in a column
commanded by Lieutenant-General Ian Hamilton.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<p>The battalion was not actively engaged on the 27th of August in the
battle of Bergendal, though some of the companies on outpost came under
long-range artillery fire from the formidable position astride of the railway,
which Lord Roberts and Sir Redvers Buller attacked respectively
in front and flank. When the Boers fell back from their carefully prepared
entrenchments they retired at first along the railway; but <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'under the disspiriting'">under the dispiriting</ins>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
influences of this, its latest defeat, the burgher army soon began
to fall to pieces. One column struck southward; a second hurried eastward
towards the Portuguese frontier; while a third, commanded by General
L. Botha, turned northwards and headed for the maze of hills by which the
town of Lydenburg is surrounded. This detachment made so firm a stand
at Badfontein that Sir Redvers Buller, who had been entrusted with its
pursuit, asked for reinforcements, and General Ian Hamilton was sent to
his help with the greater part of his column. Starting from Belfast on
September 3, Hamilton, after two days’ hard marching and continuous
skirmishing, succeeded in placing himself on the right rear of Botha’s
entrenched line at Badfontein; the Boers thereupon drew off eastward to
Paardeplaatz, a huge mountain within distant cannon-shot of Lydenburg.
As a preliminary to dislodging the burghers from this new position, the
British troops occupied Lydenburg during the morning of the 7th; in the
afternoon, after the bivouacs had been formed, the soldiers were allowed to
bathe in the creeks; they were splashing about in the water, when suddenly
two 6-in. guns began to fire from Paardeplaatz, ten or eleven
thousand yards off, and an unlucky shell killed two men of the battalion
and dangerously wounded another.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> The Royal Irish were at once moved
to a place of safety, and for the rest of the day had the satisfaction
of watching the Boer gunners waste invaluable ammunition upon the
empty shelters of the bivouac. Next day (the 8th) Paardeplaatz was
carried by the British troops. The Boers held a precipitous hill, 1500 feet
in height, and shaped exactly like a horse-shoe: the only track ran
to the farthest point of the shoe up an ever-narrowing ridge, cleft
asunder in various places by deep dongas, almost impassable even by
infantry. Two 6-in. guns commanded the path, and lighter guns and
pom-poms were posted on various points along the crest. Hamilton was
ordered to attack in front and to turn the left flank, while Buller worked
round the right of Botha’s line. Although the turning movements involved
several hours of hard marching and scrambling, the frontal and flank
attacks were delivered simultaneously, and carried the position with a rush.
A wing of the Royal Irish (F, G, H companies, and the volunteers) under
Major Hatchell were the first troops to reach the topmost ridge, which
commanded the enemy’s only line of retreat, a natural causeway a few yards
wide, with deep precipices on either side of it. This road was crowded
with Boers, who, after saving their guns, were now in full retreat; the mass
presented a splendid target for musketry, but just as the men were bringing
their rifles into play down fell a mountain mist, completely veiling the
burghers from their view. To pursue amidst the precipices in such a fog
was impossible; the only thing left to do was to fire volleys in the direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
taken by the enemy, who is said to have suffered some loss from these
unaimed bullets. The British casualties were small; and in the Royal
Irish only one man was wounded.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>Hamilton now returned to the railway, and then moved eastwards
towards Komati Poort, over country in places so difficult as to be almost
impassable. For instance, part of his route lay over hills so steep that in the
ten miles between Godwaan station and Kaapsche Hoop the track rose
2200 feet. To lighten the loads, the wooden cases enclosing the biscuit
tins were removed, and the soldiers were made to carry their second
blankets, usually transported in the waggons. As the column toiled up
the steep inclines, the troops hauled the vehicles after them by main force,
and when the descent began, each waggon was held back by ten men, who
steadied it with drag-ropes down the worst places on the road. Though
Hamilton encountered none of the enemy, the march was in many ways
an exciting one. A company of the battalion was crossing a railway bridge
only wide enough to carry a train, when the sound of an engine was heard
in a cutting hard by, and an officer who was present wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I know my hair stood on end. A scramble ensued, which is rather
amusing to <em>look back upon</em>. Some of us just slipped over the edge and
hung on by the sleepers, with the torrent, thirty or forty feet below,
to fall into, and rocks to land on if you missed the water. The train
was, however, pulled up before getting on to the bridge, and all got
safely over. I believe the rear-guard saw a lion on the last march
down the Kaap valley into Kaapmuiden. One of the men in my company
woke up one fine morning to find a snake asleep beside him. It
was with some difficulty he was able to persuade his fellows he was
not a de Rougemont, and when at last they carefully pulled off the
blankets&mdash;the wretched fellow was sweating at every pore with fright&mdash;they
discovered a particularly venomous-looking puff adder coiled up
between his legs! The snake was duly killed, but I imagine that man
will never forget the horrible five minutes he must have spent before
persuading those around he was not blarneying them.”</p></div>

<p>On September 25, Hamilton caught up the advance-guard of the army at
Komati Poort, where an amazing amount of stores and railway plant had
been found, but no enemy. On the approach of the British the burghers
had broken into small bands and disappeared along the Portuguese frontier;
some returned to their homes and either took no further part in the
war or joined our side; others, to whom all honour as brave and determined
enemies is due, reassembled to form the guerilla bands which kept the war
alive for twenty-one weary months after the Boer army had ceased to exist
as a formed and organised body of men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>The troops composing Hamilton’s column received his thanks for their
exertions in a general order, dated October 1, 1900&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“General Ian Hamilton wishes to congratulate his force on the fine
work which has been performed by them since they marched out of
Belfast on September 3rd, 1900. During this period they have driven
the enemy out of his most formidable selected positions&mdash;first on the
main Lydenburg road, where they barred the progress of the Natal
arms; and secondly, on the height overlooking Lydenburg itself. They
have also encountered and overcome every sort of natural obstacle, and
have carried the British flag through tracts of waterless bush, and over
ranges of lofty mountains to the most remote frontier of the enemy. All
this has been done with so much spirit, and so cheerfully, as to excite the
G.O.C.’s greatest admiration, who will take the first opportunity of
informing Lord Roberts of the splendid work done by all ranks under
his command.”</p></div>

<p>In an unofficial letter, written after the war was over, General Smith-Dorrien
stated that of all the troops which came under his orders in South
Africa, “none served me more loyally or gave me less trouble than the Royal
Irish; I have nothing but pleasant associations to remember with regard
to the time I had the honour of having the battalion under my command.”</p>

<p>The Royal Irish spent a few days in clearing the railway and in attending
a review of the British troops, held in honour of the birthday of the King of
Portugal, and then were ordered to entrain for Belfast; the journey, by no
means an uneventful one, is vividly described by Captain Dease.</p>

<p>“The regiment returned from Komati Poort in several trains, as there
was an excess of rolling stock on the line which wanted moving up
towards Pretoria. The Boers had made quite a mess of things on the
railway. They had fired great numbers of trucks and disabled a good
many engines. The big bridge across the Kaap at Kaapmuiden had also
been destroyed, and rather cleverly too. They had blown down the
upper part of one of the piers, got steam up in one of the heavier ‘Free
State Railway’ engines, set it going from Kaapmuiden station, and
succeeded in absolutely smashing up the damaged pier, as well as the
spans on either side. The volunteers and C company did most of the
work on the building of a deviation and temporary bridge, which was
taken in hand immediately. We left Kaapmuiden at about 5 <span class="fs70">P.M.</span> on
the 30th September. As I had had some mechanical training as a boy, I
took on the driving of the second train, in which were most of our
officers. The first train was given five minutes’ grace before I was told
to start. My fireman was a corporal in the Royal Scots, I think, who
had ‘been on’ a traction engine at home, while the second man was also
a soldier from some other regiment, with an equal recommendation for
his present job! I myself had a fair knowledge of locomotive work, but
(at that time) little of the vacuum brake: anyway, I certainly had not
sufficient knowledge of the work for the job in hand. All went well till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
we got to the deviation and bridge we had made over the Kaap. Here
the fun began. The road up the other side was at so steep a gradient
that I couldn’t get my train up it. We stopped and rolled back
over the bridge. A second try met with as little success. It then
occurred to my fireman and myself that if we ‘backed’ up the grade
behind the bridge, and then rushed forward down on to the bridge the
momentum would carry us over. This it did, but the train must have
had a narrow escape of wrecking that frail, temporary structure. After
this we proceeded ‘with caution,’ going not more than about 10 miles an
hour. Darkness fell about three or four miles beyond the Kaap bridge.
The ‘road’ here runs along the sides of hills, with a steep slope to the
Krokodil Valley, a couple of hundred feet below. Naturally the curves
are very sharp, and cuttings numerous. I was very ‘jumpy’ at the time,
not knowing the road and uncertain of myself as a driver, and kept the
speed down. It was fortunate I did so, for as we rounded a corner a
group of men on the hillside shouted to me to ‘stop,’ ‘danger,’ &amp;c. I
jammed down the air-brake hard and shut off steam, bringing the train
up with a terrific jerk, to find the buffer of my engine within a few yards
of the rear of the train in front. The sudden pull up had caused quite an
upset in the trucks behind, as the jerk was hard enough to roll everyone
and everything in the trucks over. We found that the driver of the first
train’s engine (also an amateur like myself) had allowed the water to run
too low in his boiler, melting the plug over his fire-box, and rendering
the engine totally useless. We were still talking about our narrow
escape when suddenly round the curve behind us were seen the front
lights of a third train. We happened to have no ‘tail lights,’ and before
warning could be given our train had been run into with a terrific
smash from behind. For a few minutes the confusion was indescribable.
Then things straightened themselves out. A piquet was sent some
distance down the line to prevent another train colliding with the third
train, and parties went to work extricating the injured. The extraordinary
thing was that although quite a number of trucks had been
‘piled up’ in our train, nobody was killed, and only about thirty or forty
hurt. One of the latter was Deane-Morgan: he had been standing on
the edge of a culvert when the crash came, and, without thinking, he
involuntarily took a step backwards, and dropped about thirty feet or so
into the bed of a nullah. He hurt his knee badly, but no bones were
broken&mdash;another extraordinary escape.</p>

<p>“We spent that night and part of the next morning clearing away
the wreck, and at last arrived at Krokodil Poort, the next station, in the
afternoon. The journey thence to Waterval Onder was exciting only to
me on the engine, as it was performed through the night, but peaceful to
everyone else.”</p></div>

<p>After these adventures the Royal Irish reached Belfast on the 4th of
October, and at once relieved the troops then holding the outposts round
the town, where the duty was so heavy that when the Commander-in-Chief
ordered the battalion to Pretoria to represent Ireland at the formal
annexation of the Transvaal to the British Crown, only three companies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
could be spared to take part in the ceremony. Along the whole of the
Pretoria-Komati Poort railway, as indeed on all the lines throughout the
theatre of war, every station was held as a fortress; every train was guarded
by soldiers;<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> every bridge and almost every culvert absorbed a detachment,
great or small, for its defence; while flying columns were often required to
disperse the guerilla bands which threatened weak points on the line of
communication. Until December, the Boers in the eastern Transvaal occupied
themselves chiefly in train-wrecking; but on the 28th of that month
they stormed a strongly entrenched post at Helvetia, captured a large number
of men, and carried away in triumph a 4.7-in. gun. Encouraged by this
success, they determined to attack the posts along eighty miles of railway;
the stations at Pan, Wildfontein, Wonderfontein, Belfast, Dalmanutha,
Machadodorp, and Nooitgedacht were to be assailed simultaneously, though
the main effort was to be against Belfast, where a great depôt of stores
and much ammunition formed a prize worth striving for. Though the
headquarters of three battalions were stationed at Belfast, the Colonels of
the Royal Irish, the Shropshire Light Infantry, and the Gordon Highlanders
could muster between them no more than 1300 men&mdash;a small number of
foot soldiers with which to furnish outposts, guard the town and guns, and
reinforce threatened points on the enormous perimeter of fifteen miles
rendered necessary by the formation of the ground around the place. The
remainder of the garrison consisted of two hundred and eighty of the 5th
Lancers, a hundred and eighty mounted infantry, a battery of field artillery,
and two 4.7-in. guns.</p>

<p>Belfast was defended by three main groups of works, more of the
nature of detached posts than of outposts in the ordinary acceptation of
the term. South of the railway the Gordon Highlanders were in charge of
a long stretch of rising ground; on the other side of the line the Shropshire
Light Infantry held Colliery Hill, to the north-west of the town; while
the Royal Irish were responsible for Monument Hill, a kopje two miles
north-east of the centre of Belfast, and for one of the 4.7-in. guns, which
was posted upon it. These hills, three miles apart, were linked by a party
of mounted infantry at a drift half-way between them. Early on the 7th
of January, 1901, Major Orr’s detachment at Monument Hill was relieved by
Captain Fosbery, who was in command of his own company, A, and of D
company (Captain Milner); Lieutenant Dease was the only subaltern with
the party, which consisted of ninety-three officers, non-commissioned officers
and men. Fosbery at once began to improve and complete the partially
finished defences he had taken over from his predecessor, but the number
of workers at his disposal was not great, for D company had just returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
from an exhausting spell of train-escort duty, and as he wished to allow
Captain Milner’s men time to rest, he kept them in reserve and gave them
little to do. By sundown, however, much had been accomplished, and when
General Smith-Dorrien came to visit the post he was satisfied with the
progress made, though he disapproved of the loopholes, which he directed
should be altered, but owing to the darkness it became impossible to carry out
this order, and its execution was postponed till the morrow.</p>

<p>The top of the hill is a plateau about eight hundred yards long, and less
than a quarter of a mile in width: at the northern end a rough stone sangar,
four feet high, enclosed the 4.7-in. gun: farther to the south a semicircular
trench partly surrounded the tents occupied by D company: a short way
down the south-western slope of the hill a blockhouse of stone and sods was
virtually completed, and scattered along the perimeter of the plateau were
eight small trenches, two of which were not yet fit for use. By the scheme
of fortification the whole of the post should have been ringed with a strong
barbed-wire fence, but at nightfall this portion of the defences was not
completely finished. After Fosbery had sent two sections to a subsidiary
post connecting Monument Hill with the left of the Gordon Highlanders,
there remained in hand six sections, which he thus disposed for the night.
Two sections of A company were to man the perimeter trenches, with a
sentry posted a few yards in front of each; the remaining section of A with
the maxim was to act as a support in the sangar, from which, as will be
seen, the 4.7-in. gun had been withdrawn; the three sections of D company
were to sleep in their tents, but to be ready at a moment’s notice to line the
trench near their little camp. In the course of the evening a mist settled
down upon the country round Belfast, so heavy that in the town itself the
range of vision was limited to twenty yards; on Monument Hill it was like a
London fog, and effectually prevented patrolling to the north-east, east, and
south-east, where the precipitous sides of the kopje fell into broken ground,
difficult even by day to search with any degree of thoroughness. Thus the
safety of the post was entirely dependent on the vigilance and sharp hearing
of the sentries in front of the trenches.</p>

<p>Nothing occurred to disturb the garrison of Belfast until midnight, when
heavy firing, beginning at Monument Hill, then spreading to Colliery Hill,
and finally raging at the Gordons’ posts, showed that the burghers had
surrounded the town and were assailing it vigorously on every side. From
information obtained by the British officers captured during the engagement,
it is known that General L. Botha, who had under him about two thousand
men, had allotted to the Ermelo commando the task of driving the Gordon
Highlanders from the southern works: the Middelburg commando was to
engage the Shropshire Light Infantry at the Colliery, but not to press home
the attack until General B. Viljoen, with seven hundred and fifty of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
Johannesburg and Bocksburg commandos, had made himself master of
Monument Hill&mdash;a post which was to be carried at all cost, not only on
account of its tactical importance, but also because the burghers were determined
to capture the big gun which they thought was left at night on
the top of the kopje. Fortunately, during the 7th, General Smith-Dorrien had
decided that it should be dragged down the hill and back into the artillery
lines at nightfall; and thus the gun was preserved from the fate which
overtook the defenders of the sangar in which the Boers expected to find the
piece of ordnance they coveted so earnestly.</p>

<p>Owing to the fact that of the three officers on Monument Hill one was
killed and the others wounded and carried away by the enemy, the official
report of the part played by the Royal Irish is necessarily somewhat
meagre. But, thanks to a narrative prepared by Captain Dease, and to
information supplied by others who were present, it is possible to form some
idea of the desperate struggle for the possession of the hill. The night
piquets were posted at dusk, and the officers of A company divided the duty
between them, Fosbery taking the watch till 2 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span>, when Dease was to
relieve him. Everything was quiet till about a quarter to twelve, when
Dease, who was in a shelter near the tents of the reserve, heard a distant
challenge, followed almost immediately by the report of a rifle. Nothing
happened, and as nervous sentries often fired at imaginary enemies, no one
was disturbed by the single shot, though, as it turned out, it was fired not by a
British soldier but by a burgher, who when the sentry at the north-east trench
challenged, shot him dead. Dease was trying to go to sleep again, when
two more rifles rang out; he dashed out of his shelter, and with Fosbery,
whom he met in the fog, hurried to the centre of the plateau to ascertain the
cause of the firing. On the way they came under a sudden fusilade from a
party of Boers who, after scaling the northern and north-eastern slopes of the
kopje, had surprised and carried a couple of the trenches, thus establishing
themselves inside our line of works. The two officers rushed forward and
reached the gun sangar just as the burghers were advancing upon it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The fog,” writes Captain Dease, “at this time was extremely dense,
and the position of the enemy could only be distinguished by the flashes
of the rifles. The Boers at first concentrated on the maxim gun, and a
tremendous hand-to-hand combat took place. Our men used their
bayonets with effect, and some of the machine gunners (who had slung
their rifles in an abortive effort to get the gun to work) set-to with
picks, axes, and anything they could lay hands on. In short, as the men
said, ‘it was the father and the mother av a fight!’ The enemy suffered
so severely that they ceased trying to get over the sangar wall, but
remained a yard or two on the far side, pouring in a terrific rapid fire
at the crest line of the sangar. It is difficult to be clear about the
sequence of events, but I think that among the eighteen men originally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
in the sangar there were only one or two casualties during the hand-to-hand
part of the fight; but during the next phase, when the Boers contented
themselves with sweeping the crest, we lost very heavily, for our
fellows, the lust of battle on them after the hand-to-hand fight near the
machine gun, exposed themselves in a most reckless manner, and were
with difficulty prevented from getting out of the sangar and charging
into the enemy. The action had continued for about half an hour, when
the Boers made a second rush on the gun, and being met at that point
by a mere remnant, forced us back. At this moment, as we were
gradually drawing back towards the entrance to the sangar, 3733 Private
J. Barry,<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> who was nearest the maxim, picked up a pickaxe lying near it.
As he forced his way to the gun through the Boers, efforts were made to
stop him, and he had just time to drive in the point of the pick into the
junction of the barrel and breech-casing before he was literally swept
down by a hail of bullets from the enemy round him.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> As he was shot
at by about a dozen burghers within five yards’ distance and from all
sides, I fancy they must have played havoc in their own ranks! Fosbery
now realised that the position in the sangar was untenable, and shouting
out to us to ‘charge through the entrance and make for the blockhouse,’
led the way. The Boers were there in great force, and we were met
with a very hot but unaimed fire. Only Fosbery, Corporal Gorman, and
myself took part in this charge; all the rest of us were either killed or
wounded. About ten yards from the entrance Fosbery, in trying to club
down a Boer with the butt of his carbine, was wounded in two places: I
got a few yards farther, and while occupied with a couple of the enemy
in front was hit on the head by a butt-ended rifle, and temporarily
stunned: Corporal Gorman, I think, surrendered, but of this I am uncertain,
as I was too busy to notice what he was doing, as he was
behind me. When I recovered consciousness about ten, perhaps twenty,
minutes later, I searched for and found Fosbery, who was still alive. I
did what I could in the way of first aid, but he was hopelessly hit and
had already lost a great deal of blood. The Boers were so close to him
when they shot him down that his clothing was scorched all round the
wounds. A little after this I suddenly ran into a group of wandering
Boers, and having lost my carbine when I was knocked over, was easily
collared and put under escort. But of this and all subsequent proceedings
I can remember nothing. I had been singularly unfortunate in the
fight in jamming my revolver (a Service Webley) as I reloaded it. It
was no good to me, and I can remember using it as a missile during the
charge&mdash;I hope with effect! A carbine that night was a useless weapon
for officers. We had no bayonets, and the short length of the stock and
barrel placed us at a great disadvantage in the hand-to-hand <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</i>.”</p></div>

<p>While the support was fighting desperately in the gun sangar against
overwhelming odds, most of the piquets on the perimeter were swamped by
sheer weight of numbers. Their trenches were of a type found very useful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
by the battalion in actions where it had been exposed to continuous bombardment,
such as those in the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Colesburg campaign'">Colesberg campaign</ins>&mdash;narrow slits in the ground,
2 feet 6 inches wide, nearly 5 feet deep, loopholed with a parapet 2 feet in
height and at least 3 feet in width. But excellent as this pattern had proved
elsewhere, it was not a success in very close fighting at night, for the trench
was so deep that its occupants could not see over the parapet, and the loopholes
were ill adapted for firing on an enemy at a few yards’ range. Around
these works parties of Boers, from twenty to two hundred strong, suddenly
loomed up out of the fog and closed rapidly from all sides upon the defenders,
whom they covered with their rifles, demanding instant surrender. Though
thus caught in an absolute death-trap, most of these little groups of four or
five soldiers showed fight, not laying down their arms until one or more
of their number had been killed or wounded. Here Lance-Corporal Dowie, a
veteran who had served in the Egyptian war of 1882, met a glorious death.
He was in command of a small trench, which he succeeded in holding during
the first assault: he refused to surrender, though he must have realised that
resistance was hopeless, and with his men continued to fight on desperately
until a number of burghers, rushing in from behind, overwhelmed the party
and left Dowie dead in the work he had defended so gallantly.</p>

<p>The reserve fared no better than the piquets or the support. When
awakened by the sound of battle, the men of D company manned the broad
and shallow trench by which, as it has been said, their tents were enclosed,
though very incompletely. At first the attack came from their front and
right, but after the capture of the sangar had made the Boers masters of the
northern end of the hill, a fresh body of the enemy fell upon them from the
left rear. There was a short, wild struggle; then the burghers surged
forward, and hemmed in the men of D so closely that many of them could
not use their bayonets, and while the Boers in front seized the muzzles
and pointed them in the air, those behind knocked our men down with
the butts of their Mauser rifles. By this time Captain Milner was severely
wounded: and those of his company who were not killed, wounded, or
prisoners ceased to be a formed body of troops. Singly or in small groups
they tried to make their way towards Belfast, but in the fog they stumbled
across large parties of the enemy, into whose hands they fell. Out of the
ninety-three officers and men of the Royal Irish on the hill only seven
escaped; the remainder were killed, wounded, or captives in the hands of
the enemy. Little more than half an hour after the first shot was fired the
defence had been beaten down completely, and the only sounds to be heard
on Monument Hill were the groans of the wounded, and the hoarse shouts of
the burghers as they collected the rifles and ammunition and sought vainly
for the 4.7-in. gun, which they hoped to turn upon the garrison of the town.</p>

<p>When the attack began General Smith-Dorrien had only two companies&mdash;(one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
of the Royal Irish and one of the Shropshire Light Infantry) available
as reinforcements for the posts north of the line. Both companies turned
out, stood to their arms, and awaited orders, while Lieutenant-Colonel
Spens, Shropshire Light Infantry, at once reconnoitred towards Monument
Hill, and before the firing had quite died down, met a soldier who gave
him the grim news that Fosbery’s detachment had been cut to pieces.
Halting his party, Spens went forward with two or three men to ascertain
for himself the real position of affairs, and, undetected by the enemy, worked
his way up the kopje until he reached a wire fence from which he could
see the burghers swarming over the camp which they were looting. Then,
convinced that the post was lost indeed, he withdrew, taking with him
the men of two small outlying piquets whom the enemy had not discovered,
but who, in his opinion, would inevitably be captured as soon as
the fog lifted. This daring reconnaissance was equalled by that of a
corporal in the 5th Lancers, who volunteered to find out what had happened
to the Royal Irish. He thus described the scene upon the hill&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I left the road and struck across the veld, and by running, creeping,
crawling, and rolling I managed to get up to the wire entanglements
which encircled the post. The difficulty now was to get through the
wire. I could hear shouts and groans, and there was some shooting
going on, but whether Briton or Boer was in possession I could not
tell. I dared not go round the entanglement to the entrances, as I
knew they would be guarded, and so by a series of wriggles soon
found myself inside the post. What was to be done now? I knew
if I were seen I should be shot, whoever held the hill, so I continued
to wriggle and roll on my stomach. I soon came across the effects of
the fight, the dead bodies of the infantry and Boers, and the tents which
had been cut down on top of the Irishmen. Some one was calling
‘Water, for God’s sake give me water,’ and suddenly a dog barked a
few yards to my right, and I could just distinguish a man. I
immediately covered him with my rifle, but apparently he had not
seen me. I remained where I was for some time, and then slowly
crawled back a little and worked my way to where I heard the shouts
for water coming from. I soon found two of the Irishmen badly
wounded, and asked them in a whisper what had happened, but the
only reply was a piteous appeal for water. I then crawled some fifty
yards to the cook-house and found a camp kettle with some water in
it, and slowly wriggled back to the two wounded men, and filling my
cap with water gave them a good drink. They then told me that
the Boers had rushed the sentries in the fog, cutting down the tents
on their occupants, and shooting and clubbing the men as they rushed
out, and although the garrison had made a gallant fight they were
overpowered and the post captured. There was a lot of shouting going
on by the Boers, and I quietly crawled towards it, and then there was
a shot. Beyond a man standing on the monument I could see nothing,
and so gradually crawled back to the wire entanglements; as soon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
I was clear of these ran back to the horses, where I found Sergeant
Evans and Aldridge safe, and we rode back to camp and made our
report.”<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p></div>

<p>Along the rest of the line of outworks the enemy pressed home the attack
with great gallantry and determination, but was repulsed at all important
points. The Gordon Highlanders beat back Botha’s burghers, though with
the loss of a small isolated post, and the Shropshire Light Infantry maintained
their hold on the vital part of their position, though also with the
loss of a small outlying detachment. Only at Monument Hill were the
Boers successful, and this success, obtained solely by overwhelming numbers,
they failed to turn to account. Whether they were dispirited by their losses,
bewildered by the fog, or crippled by the want of trained staff officers to
direct their movements and carry out Botha’s plans, it is impossible to say,
but the fact remains that beyond capturing some scores of rifles, a few
tents, and much ammunition from the Royal Irish, the burghers accomplished
nothing, and retired so hastily with their prisoners and booty that when
Spens returned in the early morning to Monument Hill he found it occupied
only by the dead and wounded.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that Botha’s scheme provided for the simultaneous
attack on seven posts along the railway. These attacks were duly made,
but in most cases they were not serious, and in none were they successful.
The returns prove that Belfast was the real objective of the burghers, for
out of 179 casualties sustained in the defence of these seven places, 143
fell upon the troops in Belfast. The Royal Irish were by far the greatest
sufferers; of the three officers on Monument Hill, Captain Fosbery was killed,
Captain Milner was severely wounded, Lieutenant Dease injured, and both
were taken prisoners; while among the ninety non-commissioned officers
and privates eight were killed outright, five died of their wounds, twenty-two
were wounded in varying degrees of severity, and fifty-one were taken
prisoner.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> The Boers on their side also lost heavily: in the attack on Belfast
fifty-eight burghers were killed, of whom fourteen fell at Monument
Hill.</p>

<p>General Smith-Dorrien, in his report on the events of the 7th-8th of
January, stated that the heavy loss in killed and wounded among the
Royal Irish was “sufficient evidence that their defence was a fine one.”
He specially mentioned Captain Fosbery for his “splendid work in command
of the post,” adding that from all sides he heard how well this officer had
behaved until he was shot down. In Force Orders, dated the 12th of January,
1901, he expressed his</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“appreciation of the steadiness of the troops on the morning of the 8th.
He would specially mention the fine defence of the Royal Irish piquet at
the monument under that gallant officer, Captain Fosbery, whose death
he deplores, until overwhelmed by vastly superior numbers after a hard
fight.... He regrets the heavy losses, but does not consider them heavy,
considering the determined nature of the attack. He also considers that
had it not been for the fog the attack would have been much more easily
repulsed.”</p></div>

<p>The General also wrote as follows of Private John Barry:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I would especially call attention to the heroic conduct of No. 3733
Private J. Barry, Royal Irish, who seeing the machine gun surrounded by
Boers seized a pick and began to smash the action, which he completed in
spite of the threats of the Boers. I regret to say that the Boers in
retaliation shot him dead, or I would have recommended him for a V.C.”</p></div>

<p>The War Office decided to award this honourable decoration to Barry,
although he was not alive to wear it, and it was presented to his widow
to be held as a treasured heirloom in Barry’s family. Thus, for the third
time since the Order of the Victoria Cross was instituted, did a member
of the Royal Irish regiment win this, the highest prize for valour in the
British army.</p>

<p>For several days the garrison of Belfast toiled continuously to make
good the weak points in the defences revealed by the night attack, and
then settled down into the old routine of occasional raids into the neighbouring
country and frequent skirmishes on the line of communication. A
party of the Royal Irish under Captain Grogan had an extraordinary escape
while escorting a train about this time; the burghers had mined the railway
with dynamite and expected to see the train and its guard of soldiers
blown sky-high, but their hopes were disappointed; a couple of heavily
laden trucks in front of the engine met the full force of the explosion and
were hurled off the rails; none of the escort were hurt, and the greater
part of the train was uninjured.</p>

<p>On February 22, F, G, and H companies under Major Orr were sent
to Helvetia, where they spent a fortnight in remodelling the defences, and
then moved on to Lydenburg as escort to a convoy of supplies for the
troops holding that distant post. Though unopposed by the enemy the
march was very trying, for the rain fell in torrents, and the road, deep
in mud, led across three rivers where the water reached to the waists of
the soldiers as they struggled through the fords. Very soon after the
convoy reached its destination Lieutenant-Colonel C. W. Park, Devonshire
regiment, who at that moment was senior officer at Lydenburg, learned
that a small commando of about seventy Boers had established itself in
a valley near Krugerspost, twelve or fourteen miles north of the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
camp. He determined to capture the laager, and on the 13th of March
issued orders for the night march by which the burghers were to be encircled
and surprised. The infantry selected for the enterprise were three
companies of the Rifle Brigade, three of the Devonshire, and the detachment
of the Royal Irish, now under command of Captain W. H. White, vice
Major Orr, who had been obliged to go into hospital. They were to be
carried in ox waggons for six miles; then after dismounting they were to
make a long sweep across the veld to avoid a Boer piquet, the position
of which had been ascertained, and on reaching a specified point break
into three small columns, and crown the hills commanding the laager. The
operation was by no means easy, for its success demanded not only that
the troops should accomplish the various stages of the march within the
time allowed by the calculations of the staff, but also that the guides should
lead the detachments quickly and unerringly to the appointed places.</p>

<p>As soon as the column left the road its troubles began: the surface
of the veld was seamed with spruits, pitted with bogs, and covered with
high grass; it was impossible to move in close formation, and once the
companies had been opened out, it became so difficult to maintain connection
between the various units that when the troops reached the spot
where the encircling movement was to begin, they were half an hour
“behind scheduled time.” The Royal Irish detachment was now handed
over to a guide, who led it along a ravine which every moment grew
narrower and steeper. At first the man seemed confident in himself; then
suddenly he lost his head, and confessed he was doubtful about the exact
position of the laager. The situation was serious, for if the Royal Irish
did not succeed in making their way to the ground allotted to them in
the scheme of attack, there would be a gap in the enveloping line through
which the Boers might easily escape. Captain White accordingly sent
Lieutenant Panter-Downes with H company up the ravine with orders
to push on and connect with the left of the Devons, while he himself
moved the remainder of the detachment farther to the left to feel for
the Rifle Brigade. Just as the first glimmer of dawn was showing in
the east a message from Panter-Downes arrived to report that he had discovered
the laager, which was not visible from the slope up which White
was climbing. While F and G companies linked up with the Riflemen
and gained a crest commanding the Boer camp, H strove to get into touch
with the Devons, but before Panter-Downes could make his way across a
very difficult piece of broken ground the Boers took the alarm, discovered
the gap in our line, and hurled themselves upon it, not without success,
for though they left thirty-seven of their number in our hands, the remainder
of the commando escaped. Some of them owed their liberty to the chivalry
of the Royal Irish; in the words of the Record of Service they “would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
have been shot down had they not worn long night-drawers and so been
mistaken for women.” Though about half the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">personnel</i> of the commando
got away, all its <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matériel</i>&mdash;tents, waggons, horses, and much grain&mdash;fell
into Colonel Park’s hands at a cost of only five casualties, all among
the Royal Irish.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>

<p>In a few days the detachment returned to the railway and rejoined the
battalion, which now had been withdrawn from the garrison of Belfast to
take part in active operations in the northern Transvaal. Early in the year
the Intelligence department had become aware that the repeated attacks upon
the railway were intended to divert attention from the preparations for a
great raid to the southward, by which General Botha hoped to restore the
shattered fortunes of the republican armies. Lord Kitchener, who on Lord
Roberts’ departure for England in December, 1900, had succeeded to the
supreme command of the British forces in South Africa, first sent General
French with 22,000 combatants to harry Botha’s commandos south of the
Pretoria-Delagoa Bay line, and then organised a body of nearly 10,000 men
with whom Lieutenant-General Sir B. Blood was to sweep a huge piece of
country, bounded on the south by the same railway, on the north by the 25th
degree of latitude, on the east by the Stenkamps Berg, and on the west by the
Oliphant river. The principal settlement in this district was Roos Senekal,
on which Blood’s troops were to converge from various points. Three of the
columns were commanded by Major-General F. W. Kitchener, the remainder
by Major-General R. S. R. Fetherstonhaugh; the Royal Irish were allotted to
that under the immediate orders of Colonel Park, who was one of Kitchener’s
subordinate commanders. Leaving the railway on March 27, the battalion
reached Lydenburg on April 11, where began six months of work as arduous,
monotonous, and disagreeable as ever British soldiers were called upon to
perform. On some occasions the Royal Irish formed part of an outer ring
of troops whose business it was to block every Nek and every drift by which
a commando could break from the net that was closing upon it; at other
times, as part of the striking column, they made forced marches by day and
night, too often to find that the burghers had taken the alarm and had
fled, leaving behind them their womenkind, who they knew would be well
treated by the British. They had to “round-up” great mobs of cattle, to
remove women and children from farms used as headquarters by the local
guerillas, to escort convoys, and to march incessantly “in a most difficult
country over almost impossible roads.” For weeks together they never
bivouacked twice in the same place, and whenever they found themselves
for a few days at Lydenburg or at a station on the line, instead of resting,
they had to build blockhouses. On one of these brief visits to the comparative
civilisation of the railway the battalion was joined by Lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
W. G. Lindsey and thirty non-commissioned officers and men of the 5th (Irish
volunteer battalion), the King’s (Liverpool) regiment, who on May 20, 1901
arrived to replace the volunteer company which on October 8, 1900, had
started on its journey back to England.</p>

<p>A detailed account of the work of the regiment between April and October,
1901, would contain so little beyond a list of bivouacs at places with uncouth
and unknown names, that no attempt will be made to follow the wanderings of
the Royal Irish: the reader who desires to know their exact position on every
day throughout this period will find the information in <a href="#APPENDIX_8">Appendix 8</a>. At the
end of September the battalion, to use the South African expression, “came
off trek,” and as soon as it had been refitted, relieved the Manchester regiment
at Lydenburg. An idea of the straits to which the men had been reduced
by hard marching will be gathered from a report dated September 1: “many
have no shirts at all, and others have no boots. All the boots and trousers
are in a bad state and will not hold together much longer.”</p>

<p>Colonel Park took the opportunity of thanking the officers and men for
their services in a farewell order dated October 1, 1901&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is with the greatest regret that the Officer Commanding the
column has now to part with the first battalion, the Royal Irish regiment,
the last remaining unit of the original force which started from Lydenburg
under his command five and a half months ago.</p>

<p>“The splendid fighting qualities of the Royal Irish are well known to
all, and their magnificent marching powers and the good spirit of all
ranks under the hardships and privations of active service have been the
admiration of the O.C. column, and of all ranks who have served with
him. Colonel Park wishes them the best of good luck, and trusts that at
some future time he may have again the honour of serving with this
gallant and distinguished regiment.”</p></div>

<p>Though the war had already lasted for two years, the strenuous exertions
of Botha, De Wet, and a few other Boer leaders prolonged the struggle,
hopeless though it was, for nine months longer. During this time the
battalion remained at Lydenburg, taking its share of duty in garrisoning
the town, in escorting convoys, and in manning the fifty-five blockhouses by
which the place was linked with the railway at Machadodorp, forty-five miles
away. From the regimental point of view only two incidents worthy of
record occurred in this phase of the war: the capture of B. Viljoen, the Boer
general who had inflicted so heavy a loss upon the Royal Irish at Monument
Hill, and the destruction by dynamite of a blockhouse held by a party of
the Royal Irish.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the year 1902, Schalk Burger, the acting President
of the Transvaal Republic, was in hiding near Dulstroom with the few
adherents who formed his so-called government. Viljoen, the commander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
of the remnants of the commandos raised in the districts north of the Pretoria-Delagoa
Bay railway, had been driven to Pilgrim’s Rest, whence Burger
summoned him to a conference to arrange for the transfer of the “government”
to the comparative safety of that remote settlement. The preliminaries
being settled, Viljoen preceded Burger on the journey over the fifty miles of
country between Dulstroom and Pilgrim’s Rest. This ride, writes the author
of the Official History, “proved to be the last of the Boer leader’s many
adventures. The British Intelligence Department was keenly watching the
vagrant legislature; and ambuscades lay in many a likely spruit-bed and
rail and river crossing. Into one of these traps&mdash;laid by a party of the Royal
Irish regiment, sent out under Major A. S. Orr by Lieut.-Colonel H. Guinness&mdash;fell
Viljoen as, having stolen past the outposts of Lydenburg, he made to
ford the Spekboom river.” The details of the capture were as follows:
at about 7 <span class="fs70">P.M.</span> on January 25, 1902, Major Orr with five officers and a
hundred and twenty of the other ranks was suddenly ordered to hasten to
two drifts, where it was reported that a party of burghers would attempt to
cross during the night.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> Captain Farmer was sent with a detachment to
block one of these drifts; near the other Major Orr hid the remainder of his
force, posting twenty men in a ruined farmhouse a few hundred yards to his
flank.</p>

<p>By 10 o’clock at night the trap was set, and the soldiers were resting after
their long march over heavy mealie-fields and through spruits swollen by
recent rain, when the detachment in the farm opened a sharp fusilade on a
small number of Boers approaching from the south-west, and drove them
towards the drift where Orr had established himself. So perfectly in hand
were the Royal Irish that, though they could hear horses galloping towards
them, they remained silent and motionless until the leading horsemen, who
rode in pairs, were almost under the muzzles of their rifles. Then Colour-Sergeant
J. Boulger, who was nearest the road, shouted “Hands up.” Disregarding
this summons the Boers galloped on: Boulger realising that they
meant to dash through the drift, opened fire on the horses of the two Boers in
front: his men followed his example, and the animals, one pierced by nine,
the other by three bullets, dropped dead, in their fall pinning to the ground
their riders, Viljoen and Bester, one of the General’s staff. Then there was a
short confused skirmish, in which Nel, another of Viljoen’s staff, and a Cape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
Boer lost their lives; the remainder of the party, which numbered ten in all,
escaped, though not across the drift. As soon as Viljoen and Bester had been
drawn from beneath their horses, they were recognised by one of the civilian
scouts, who told Major Orr the names of the prisoners. Between men who
have frequently faced each other in battle arises a curious feeling of quasi-friendship,
and the Royal Irish and the commandos led by Viljoen had
frequently met on many a hard-fought field: moreover, after Monument Hill
Viljoen had treated his prisoners, both officers and men, with great kindness:
therefore, as Orr hurried his captives to Lydenburg he assured them that they
had fallen into good hands, and during the few days that Viljoen remained at
Lydenburg awaiting an escort to the railway the regiment did its best to
make his captivity agreeable. The burghers were very anxious to rescue him;
and one night, writes an officer, “two or three of them stole into the town to
see if it was possible to dig him out, but finding a sentry at his door and
another at his window gave up the attempt, leaving behind them a clever
cartoon of Lord Kitchener sitting in a zariba of barbed wire, surrounded by
surrendered burghers whom he was imploring to go out and persuade the
others to come in, while floating above him was the spirit of Joe Chamberlain!
The drawing was signed, ‘Phil Jung, with apologies to Phil May.’” In his
report Colonel Guinness specially mentioned Major Orr, to whose good dispositions
of the force at his command was due the successful issue of the
affair, and Colour-Sergeant Boulger,<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> who had been very favourably reported
upon by Major Orr.</p>

<p>The dynamite episode occurred two months later. Among the blockhouses
held by the Royal Irish was one, named by the troops Ben Tor,
which stood on a kopje so thickly covered with big boulders that the sentries
could not watch all the approaches to it. The building was of stone, roofed
with sheets of galvanised iron; and on the night of the 18th of March
it was held by a non-commissioned officer&mdash;Sergeant M‘Grath&mdash;and nine
private soldiers. About two o’clock in the morning of the 19th, the two
men on sentry outside the blockhouse heard sounds which they rightly interpreted
to be those of approaching feet. While one remained on the look-out,
the other crawled into the blockhouse and reported to Sergeant M‘Grath,
who immediately stood to arms and manned his loopholes, but almost before
the men were in their places a bomb was hurled on the roof, which unfortunately
being flat, not sloping, afforded the missile a secure lodgment.
In a second there was a tremendous explosion: the blockhouse was wrecked;
one of the walls was thrown down, and every man of the garrison dangerously
or severely wounded, except the sentry outside who escaped all injury.
After capturing this man the Boers waited for some minutes to see if any
one was still on foot; then, satisfied that no resistance was to be expected,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
they rapidly looted the blockhouse and decamped, fortunately without finding
the boxes of reserve ammunition hidden under the sheets of galvanised iron
which formed the beds of the garrison. Beyond stripping some of the
wounded, the burghers did their victims no harm, and sent off the uninjured
soldier to summon medical aid from Lydenburg. By dawn a detachment of
troops, a doctor, and an ambulance were on the way to Ben Tor, where, says
one of the officers, “the place was like a shambles&mdash;too horrible to describe.”
As soon as the wounded men had been removed,<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> the blockhouse was rebuilt
and greatly strengthened.</p>

<p>Nothing of note occurred in the battalion during the remainder of the
campaign, which was brought to an end by the declaration of peace on May
31, 1902. This is not the place to discuss the terms upon which the Boer
guerillas were allowed to surrender their arms and return to their homes; to
enumerate the enormous sums spent by the Imperial Treasury in rebuilding
and restocking the burghers farms, or to speculate on what may be the
ultimate effect on South Africa and the Empire of the policy by which, little
more than five years after the last shot was fired in the war, all the rights
and privileges of self-government were granted to our former enemies. Whatever
the future may have in store for England, the Royal Irish regiment
will always have the satisfaction of remembering that throughout the long
struggle with the Boer republics, all ranks worthily maintained the honour
of their corps.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The doings of the officers and men who served in the mounted infantry
are in no degree less interesting than those of the first battalion, but,
unfortunately, want of space renders it impossible to describe in detail the
many engagements and operations of importance in which they took part.
All that can be attempted is a bare outline of their work, with a few instances
of the many exploits which the independent nature of their employment gave
them the opportunity to perform. Though for a time the two contingents
were in the same brigade, they were employed together so seldom that their
movements are chronicled separately.</p>

<p>When the first battalion was called upon to provide a section for Captain
St Leger’s Cork company of the 1st regiment of mounted infantry, commanded
by Colonel E. A. H. Alderson, the choice fell upon Second Lieutenant
P. U. Vigors and thirty-seven non-commissioned officers and men, who
landing at Cape Town early in November, 1899, were sent up country to
De Aar, a place important as a great railway junction and an advanced base,
where large quantities of stores had been accumulated. Here they spent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
nearly three months, chiefly on detached duties, such as guarding the railway
bridge at Hanover Road, outposts, and patrols, one of which once pushed out
as far as Prieska in the north-west of Cape Colony. Early in February,
1900, the 1st regiment of mounted infantry was allotted to the 1st brigade
of mounted infantry, a newly-formed body under Colonel O. C. Hannay, and
composed of the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th regiments of mounted infantry (all
regular soldiers) and several corps of Australian and South African volunteers.
In the 5th regiment the Royal Irish were well represented; it was commanded
by Major Hatchell, an officer of the XVIIIth; and one company, or
a quarter of its total strength, had been contributed by the first battalion.</p>

<p>The Royal Irish section of the Cork company of the 1st mounted infantry
charged with the cavalry at Klip Drift, and took part in the relief of
Kimberley; reached Paardeberg some days before Cronje surrendered, and
shared in the actions of Poplar Grove and Driefontein. In the operations
outside Bloemfontein on March 12, the Cork company succeeded in forestalling
the Boers in the occupation of an important kopje, just north of the
Leper hospital. At the disastrous affair at Sannah’s Post on the 31st of
March, where the section served in the rear-guard covering the retreat of our
broken force, all did well, and an officer and a lance-corporal especially distinguished
themselves. As Captain St Leger was superintending the retirement
of the rear section of the Cork company he saw a big man, dismounted,
running after the horsemen. St Leger called him, and ascertained that he
was Corporal Parker, 1st Life Guards, who after escaping from the trap in
the Korn spruit had attached himself to the mounted infantry. While the
corporal was speaking he was shot through the right shoulder, and at that
moment St Leger’s orderly, Drummer Radford, noticed that his officer was
staying behind and rode back to him. Thinking he could manage the Life
Guardsman alone, St Leger ordered Radford to return to the company, but
when he tried to get the trooper on to his (St Leger’s) horse, failed to do so,
for the man’s wound had made him incapable of helping himself, and he was
too heavy to be lifted into the saddle. There was no time to be lost, so with
his right arm round the trooper’s waist, he half supported, half dragged him
in the direction in which the Cork company had retired. With his left hand
St Leger led his horse, which grew very restive under the pitiless hail of
bullets that literally tore up the ground under the animal’s belly. As the
Boers followed up the little group, now completely isolated and a long way
behind the last of the rear-guard, the outlook seemed almost hopeless.
Suddenly St Leger realised that if he could succeed in getting his wounded
man a few hundred yards farther on, they would not only find temporary
cover in some low-lying and broken ground, but would also be protected by
the fire of a party of Roberts’ Horse who, some distance off, were holding
back the enemy on this part of the battlefield. The burghers came on fast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
and three of them galloped up to within a hundred yards of the fugitives,
and emptied their magazines at them as they disappeared into cover. As the
Boers fired from the saddle none of their bullets took effect. Bad as the
situation was, it grew worse when the section of Roberts’ Horse turned
about, and galloped to a position farther to the rear. Happily St Leger
managed to attract the attention of one of them&mdash;a gallant man, who raced
back to him with a led horse, on which they managed to hoist the Life
Guardsman, who, though faint from his wound, was still able to ride once he
was in the saddle. Then they galloped hard, scattering in order to offer a
smaller target to the shower of Mauser bullets by which they were pursued.
Corporal Parker recovered from his wound completely; and neither the
trooper in Roberts’ Horse nor Captain St Leger was hit; indeed, good luck
followed the latter throughout the day, for thanks to the resolution of his
groom, Private Ward, his favourite pony was saved from the general wreck
of the column. Private Ward was riding with the waggons when they fell
into the ambush; when called upon to surrender, he refused to do so, and
though his own horse was hit, succeeded in escaping with St Leger’s pony,
in whose saddle-bags were sixty sovereigns, just received for the men’s pay.
Lance-Corporal Hall distinguished himself by two acts of signal bravery
under very heavy fire. Noticing a wounded gunner staggering along in the
retreat he rode back to him, and placed him upon his own horse: later in
the day, when the Boers were pressing hard upon the mounted infantry, he
saw a trooper of Roberts’ Horse whose pony had been killed and who was in
imminent danger of being shot or captured. He dashed after a stray horse,
caught it, and brought off the irregular in safety. Hall escaped unhurt; only
three of the Royal Irish were wounded in this engagement.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<p>The section formed part of the army which invaded the Transvaal, and
was at the passage of the Reit and the Zand rivers, the action of Johannesburg,
the capture of Pretoria, and the battle of Diamond Hill (11th and 12th
of June). For the next few weeks it remained in the neighbourhood of
Pretoria, chiefly engaged in outpost duty, sometimes of a very exciting nature.
Thus at Reitvlei, on July 15, a piquet of sixteen men was saved from
capture or destruction by the intelligence of Sergeant Connolly who, discovering
that a party of two hundred burghers with three guns was threatening
the post, reported so clearly and so promptly that his officer was able
to signal for reinforcements, which fortunately arrived in time. When Lord
Roberts began to advance towards Komati Poort the Cork company pushed
on with the remainder of the mounted infantry; a few of the Royal Irish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
section were fortunate enough to be engaged at Bergendal, but none reached
Komati Poort, the company remaining at Kaapsche Hoop until November,
when it was ordered back to Pretoria and thence to the northern frontier of
Cape Colony.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of June, De Wet had kept the Free State in a blaze,
and although after his failure in various minor enterprises he was chased up
and down the country, and very roughly handled at Bothaville on November
6, he rallied enough burghers around him to be able to swoop upon the
British garrison of Dewetsdorp, which surrendered to him on the 23rd of
November, 1900. The fall of this place seemed to remove one of the chief
obstacles to the raid into Cape Colony which for months had been discussed
round the camp fires of every Free State commando,<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> and De Wet pushed
towards the Orange river, believing that once he gained its southern bank
the Dutch population in the colony would welcome him with enthusiasm.
As soon as his plan was discovered, troops were hurried from all parts of the
theatre of war towards the Orange river, among them the column to which
the Cork company was attached. After a long and weary journey by train
from Pretoria to Bethulie, it shared in the operations in December by which
De Wet was prevented from crossing the river, and driven backwards into the
eastern Free State, where though harried incessantly by our troops he never
abandoned his scheme for a second invasion of British territory. The Cork
company was soon called away from the pursuit of De Wet to that of two of
his lieutenants, Kritzinger and Hertzog, who succeeded in passing across the
river and waged guerilla warfare in many districts of Cape Colony. Early
in February, 1901, De Wet, with extraordinary skill and equally extraordinary
good fortune, threaded his way through the troops closing round him, and
dashed across the Orange at an unguarded drift, but there his lucky star
failed him, and the British mounted troops, though almost spent by their
unending pursuit of Kritzinger and Hertzog’s raiders, who had now joined
the commandos of their leader, drove the invaders back into the Free State
at the end of February, 1901.</p>

<p>Between March and November 1901, the section was in the south of the
Free State, occupied in clearing the country and similar uncongenial duties,
the monotony of which was relieved by occasional skirmishes. In one of
these affairs two soldiers distinguished themselves. Private W. Sweeney found
himself surrounded by four mounted Boers who, covering him with their
rifles, called upon him to surrender; though they were all within fifty yards
of him he refused to do so, and firing at them from the saddle succeeded in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
making his escape. His name was specially mentioned to the General commanding
the column for his gallantry on this occasion.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> Private Radford,
while carrying a message for Lieutenant Vigors, was wounded and his horse
was hit under him; nevertheless he delivered his message and then made his
way back to report that he had done so. The next two months were spent at
Winburg, and in January, 1902, the section began to take part in the “drives”
which marked the final phase of the war in the north-east of the Free State.
In addition to the non-commissioned officer and men already mentioned,
Lieutenant Vigors, in the statement he prepared for the regimental
records, gives praise to the good conduct throughout the war of Sergeants
Kennedy and Colthorpe, Lance-Corporals Mackay and Griffin, Privates Tobin
and (5914) Power.</p>

<p>It was said on <a href="#Page_311">page 311</a> that just before the battalion sailed from England
Captain R. A. Smyth, Lieutenants S. H. L. Galbraith and E. Lloyd, with
sixty-seven of the other ranks went to the mounted infantry at Shorncliffe.
From this nucleus developed a company, composed of the same officers and
a hundred and thirty-six non-commissioned officers and men, who landed
at Cape Town on January 31, 1900, and formed part of the 5th regiment of
mounted infantry. The company received its baptism of fire on February
11, 1900, while reinforcing the flank-guard of a convoy in difficulties between
Ramah and Roodipan. In this affair Private M. Maher greatly distinguished
himself by volunteering to carry a written order to a detachment, separated
from the main body by a broad stretch of ground completely swept by
the enemy’s fire. He set an excellent example by walking, not running,
across the danger zone; delivered the note, and then, refusing to remain
with the detachment which was under cover, coolly returned to report that
the order had duly reached the officer to whom it was addressed. Maher
was not hit; in this affair there were only two casualties among the Royal
Irish, neither fatal.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> The company was at a skirmish near Jacobsdal, where
Major Hatchell was wounded; and after a long night march arrived at Klip
drift on the Modder river on the 15th, too late to take part in Lieutenant-General
French’s charge through the Boer position, though in time to see
the cavalry division re-form and start on its final advance upon Kimberley.
The Royal Irish were sent on outpost at once, and remained on
piquet until dawn, when they were ordered to work eastward down the
river to Klipkraal drift, one of the fords by which it was expected that
Cronje, now in full retreat from the kopjes of Magersfontein, would attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
to cross the stream. The company was engaged all day with the Boer rear-guard,
and several men were wounded, among whom was Sergeant Peebles,
whose experiences were singularly unpleasant;<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> while on patrol he was shot
through the thighs, and falling helpless on the ground was stripped naked by
marauding Boers, and left for dead, until late in the evening he was rescued
by a party of his comrades. After spending the night in guarding a battery
of artillery, the company at daybreak on the 17th was sent to ascertain if the
burghers still held the ground they had occupied when darkness put an end
to the combat. As soon as the Royal Irish reported that the position had
been evacuated, the column was set in motion, but the Boers had gained a
long start; their rear-guard again fought stoutly, and it was not until late
in the evening of the 17th that the mounted infantry bivouacked two miles
south of Paardeberg drift, near the laager which Cronje had formed a few
hours sooner, when to his dismay he found that he had been “headed
off” by French, who with a weak brigade of cavalry and two batteries of
Royal Horse artillery from Kimberley had thrown himself boldly across the
Boer general’s path. At 4 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span> on the 18th, Hannay’s brigade marched
eastwards to form the right of the line of troops with which Lord Kitchener
proposed to attack the enemy’s position on every side. The Royal Irish
company was engaged all day, and in the ill-fated charge led by Colonel
Hannay against the north-east face of the laager was represented by
Captain Smyth, Lieutenant Lloyd, and thirteen or fourteen non-commissioned
officers and men, of whom several privates were wounded.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> During
the remainder of the operations, ending in Cronje’s surrender on February
27, the company was employed in scouting and patrolling the country
south-east of Paardeberg; and after taking part in the action of Poplar
Grove it marched into Bloemfontein with Lieutenant-General Tucker’s column
on March 16th.</p>

<p>During the next five weeks the 5th regiment of mounted infantry was
not employed in any important operation, but at the end of April it joined
a force under Lieutenant-General Ian Hamilton, which forced its way
through the defile of Israel’s Poort, and after co-operating in driving the
Boers from Thabanchu, marched northwards as right flank-guard to the
main column in Lord Roberts’ advance from Bloemfontein to the Transvaal.
Between the 23rd of April, when the Royal Irish company left
Bloemfontein, and the 4th of June, when it entered Pretoria, there were
few days when it was not under fire, and it was present at nearly all the
actions in which the enemy was driven from one fortified position after
another. Considering how constantly the company was engaged its casualties
were not heavy: at Thabanchu, Captain Smyth and a private soldier
were wounded; at Welkom, Private Murphy was killed by a shell, which
striking him on the back of the head, hurled him ten feet out of the saddle;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
and in a fight between Heilbron and Lindley on May 20, Lieutenant
M. H. E. Welch and several men were wounded by the burghers, who after
driving in the rear-guard succeeded in getting between the main column
and the right flank-guard, of which the Royal Irish company formed part.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>
In this skirmish, where Britons and Boers were fighting in a confused
mass, Captain Smyth had a narrow escape: he had given up his horse
to a wounded Royal Irishman when a mounted burgher tried to ride him
down, but Smyth “dodged” the charge, and then laid his enemy low by a
well-aimed shot. Though the company was exposed to heavy artillery fire
at the battle of Diamond Hill, none of the officers and men were hit; and
the same good fortune attended them for many weeks, for though as part
of Hamilton’s (afterwards Hunter’s) Force, the 5th M.I. fought their way from
Heidelberg to the Brandwater Basin, there were no casualties among them
until July 28, when at Naauwpoort Nek Corporal Hogan was blown to
pieces by a shell, and a private soldier was wounded. After Prinsloo’s
surrender the company helped to escort two thousand prisoners to the
railway, reaching Winburg on August 12, and in less than a fortnight
was again “on trek,” this time in a column hurriedly despatched to the
help of a detachment which, while reconnoitring in the Doornberg range, a
few miles from Winburg, had been surrounded by a body of Boers five times
its strength. This detachment, composed of South African volunteers and a
handful of British militia, was hard pressed, and had lost nearly fifteen
per cent of its numbers when the Boers retired on the approach of the
relieving column. The only casualty among the Royal Irish was Captain
Smyth, who was so severely hurt by a fall that he was obliged to go into
hospital. Captain Brush replaced him in command of the company, at that
moment only about thirty strong, the remainder of the men being either in
hospital or stranded in various parts of South Africa waiting for remounts.</p>

<p>A few hours after the return of the troops to Winburg on the 27th
of August, the town was attacked by the Boers, who finding it too strong to
take, drew off and sent a portion of their force against Ladybrand. The 5th
mounted infantry and all other available troops were at once concentrated
at Bloemfontein, and after relieving Ladybrand hunted the commandos up
and down the Orange Free State for many weeks. As a rule the burghers
succeeded in eluding their pursuers, but on November 6, 1900, C. De Wet
with a strong body of men was surprised near Bothaville by the 5th
mounted infantry under Major K. E. Lean, Royal Warwickshire regiment,
who when Major Hatchell was wounded at Jacobsdal had succeeded him
in command. The fight began at dawn and lasted till midday, when the
timely arrival of reinforcements broke down the enemy’s resistance; De
Wet and the greater part of his followers retired in confusion, leaving
behind them a detachment of brave men, who fought stubbornly until,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
threatened by a charge of bayonets, they hoisted the white flag. Our
spoils of war included a 12-pr. Horse Artillery gun, taken by the Boers at
Sannah’s Post, and one of the 15-prs. lost by us at Colenso; four Krupps, a
pom-pom, a machine gun, much artillery and rifle ammunition, many horses
and carts, and a hundred and thirty prisoners. The Boers lost twenty-five men
killed and thirty wounded; our casualties were thirteen killed and thirty-three
wounded, among whom were three of the Royal Irish.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> Most of the
company were hotly engaged on the right of the line throughout the
action, often at very close range; while a few were attached to the
guns, where three privates of the Royal Irish greatly distinguished themselves.
One of the gun detachments was reduced to a single man, who
served his piece alone; while Privates Radigan and Maher by their steady
and well-aimed shooting kept back a party of the enemy who threatened
to take the gun in flank. In another part of the field Private Murphy was
conspicuous by his bravery in dragging a wounded officer from under
a deadly fire. Two or three days later Major-General Knox thanked the
whole of the company for their services at Bothaville, and gave especial praise
to these three men for their behaviour during the fight.</p>

<p>Soon after the 5th regiment of mounted infantry had refitted at Kroonstad
important news reached them: De Wet had recovered from his losses at
Bothaville, and had appeared in the south-east of the Free State, where
he was attacking Dewetsdorp, whose defenders were hard pressed. The
regiment was sent off by rail to Edenburg, where it joined the relieving
column, which unfortunately did not arrive in time to prevent the surrender
of the garrison. The company for the next two months marched almost
incessantly in the eastern half of the Free State, chasing De Wet, who, like
the rainbow, was always “in the next field.” They had a couple of days’ rest
at Christmas, when they bivouacked at a farm near Ficksburg, where, according
to the diary of one of the officers, “the only liquid available for our
dinner was of so substantial a nature that a mugful evaporated would leave
enough solid matter to make a good-sized brick! We shared the only dam
in the place with the horses, mules, and oxen. Tea was an impossibility, and
the coffee we swallowed with our eyes shut.” Towards the end of January,
1901, it was discovered that De Wet was secretly concentrating his burghers
for another attempt to raid into Cape Colony. Many columns, including
that in which the 5th M.I. were serving, were directed against him and caught
up his rear-guard at the Tabaksberg, where on the 29th of January the Boers
fought a delaying action, in the course of which a handful of the Royal Irish
earned praise first for their dash in “rushing” a kopje, and then for holding
it against very heavy odds. The 5th were now ordered to Bloemfontein, and
after a slow railway journey detrained at Bethulie to take part in the movements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
by which De Wet and his guerilla bands were to be expelled from
Cape Colony. They were sent off to the north-west, and so hard was the
marching that when the Royal Irish company reached Hopetown at the
end of February, it had lost sixty out of the eighty horses it possessed a
month before. In the course of the trek Private Maher again came to the
fore by volunteering to cross a drift, in order to ascertain if the farther bank
of the river was occupied by the enemy.</p>

<p>From Hopetown the company worked its way back to the east of the
Free State, on one occasion bivouacking near Ramah, where it had smelt
powder for the first time, on another halting at Hout Nek, where under
Hamilton it had fought at the beginning of May, 1900. During the remainder
of the war the 5th regiment of mounted infantry was chiefly
employed in patrolling, escorting convoys, and clearing farms, duties which
entailed incessant and monotonous work. The process of clearing a farm
of food and forage was by no means easy, especially when it had to be
done very quickly by a flank-guard under stringent orders to keep its
proper place in the column. After a harassing day’s work, an officer in
the regiment wrote in his diary that “to tell a flank-guard to clear farms
on its march is all very well in theory, but when it comes to getting sacks
of wheat or tons of loose mealies [<em>i.e.</em>, Indian corn] out of a back room
through several narrow doors or narrower windows, the flank-guard often
finds itself left behind the rear-guard. Some people seem to think that
in clearing a farm you have only to blow a whistle, and all the animals
commit suicide and all the grain jumps into the nearest dam.” It must
not be imagined that these duties were carried on unopposed. There were
frequent skirmishes; in one of these affairs (October 17, 1901) a detachment
of the Royal Irish company, finding itself surrounded by an overwhelming
force of burghers in a place from which there was no possibility
of fighting its way out, was compelled to lay down its arms after the
officer in command and three soldiers had been wounded.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The British losses in South Africa were by no means heavy, considering
that the war lasted two years and eight months, and that during a great
part of the time more than a quarter of a million of troops were in the field.
The casualties were&mdash;</p>

<p>To all who served in South Africa one, and in many cases two medals were
granted. Towards the end of 1900, it was believed officially in England that
the war was virtually at an end, and a medal was struck, bearing the effigy of
Queen Victoria, for issue to those who had taken part in the campaign. But
after the war had dragged on for more than a year longer, it was decided to
prepare a second medal with the effigy of King Edward VII., which was
to be given to all who had served in the war for eighteen months and who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
had been in South Africa on January 1, 1902. Clasps were granted for various
battles, sieges, and series of operations, and for service in certain specified areas
during the years 1899-1900; and also for service in any part of South Africa
during the years 1901-1902. The battle clasps obtained by the first battalion
were for Wittebergen (<em>i.e.</em>, Bethlehem, Slabbert’s Nek, Brandwater Basin), and
Bergendal; the Royal Irish section of the 1st mounted infantry received
clasps for the Relief of Kimberley, Paardeberg, Driefontein, Johannesburg,
Diamond Hill, and Bergendal, and the Royal Irish company of the 5th
mounted infantry for the Relief of Kimberley, Paardeberg, Johannesburg,
Diamond Hill, and Wittebergen.</p>

<p>During the war the militia battalions of the regiment were embodied, and
formed part of the garrison of the United Kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p>In memory of the members of the regular or militia battalions who died
in South Africa two memorials have been erected, one in St Patrick’s
Cathedral, the other in the barracks at Clonmel. Both are described in
<a href="#APPENDIX_10">Appendix 10</a>.</p>

<p>It has been decided that this history should end with the close of the
South African war, and therefore nothing will be said about the doings of the
regiment since May, 1902. And indeed, a detailed record would show little
beyond that unceasing training for active service for which the army and the
nation have to thank the campaign in South Africa. During this period there
have been only two incidents of note. In December, 1905, the first battalion
had the honour of sending three officers and a hundred men to guard His
Majesty George V. when, during his tour in India as Prince of Wales, he was
encamped at Kala-Ki-Serai. Three years later the same battalion was
mobilized for active service in the expedition against the Mohmands on the
north-west frontier of India; but unfortunately for the Royal Irish, this hill
campaign was brought to so speedy and successful a conclusion that they
were not called up to the front.</p>

<p>During the two hundred and twenty-seven years of its existence the
XVIIIth regiment has served in nearly all the important wars in which
England has been engaged, and has earned undying laurels whenever it has
had an opportunity of distinguishing itself. The roll of battle honours, long
as it is, by no means commemorates all the achievements of the regiment: in
the Low Countries the Royal Irish took a leading part in the storming, not
only of Namur, but of many other fortresses; in the capture of the Schellenberg,
in the engagement at Bunker’s Hill, in the defence of Toulon, and in the
fighting in Corsica the regiment won great praise, but the names of none of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
these operations are emblazoned on its Colours. Early in its career, the regiment
earned the reputation of being second to none in the British army.
This reputation it has maintained to the present day; and the author is
convinced that when in years to come, his successor writes the continuation of
this history, it will be seen that the future generations of officers and men
of the Royal Irish regiment have carried on the glorious traditions of the
XVIIIth, and have rivalled, though they could not surpass the brilliant feats
of arms which have been described in these pages.</p>

<p class="fs80">(In this Appendix an attempt has been made to collect the names of the officers, non-commissioned
officers, and private soldiers of the regiment who in its many campaigns have
been killed or wounded, or who died from accident or disease. The information about
the losses in the wars of William III. and of Marlborough is very incomplete, for it is obvious
that far greater numbers of officers and men must have perished than are recorded by
Parker, Kane, and Stearne, who only mention the casualties in battles and sieges of great
importance. The names of non-commissioned officers and men who, though wounded,
recovered from their injuries cannot be traced further back than the Crimean war.)</p>

<p class="p1 pfs85">TIRAH, 1897-8.</p>

<p class="p1 pfs80 smcap">Colonel Lawrence’s order of June 8, 1898, with extract from the Adjutant-General’s
letter exculpating the Second Battalion, Royal Irish Regiment.</p>

<p class="pfs80">(Extract.)</p>

<div class="fs80">

<p>“I am directed by the Secretary of State to inform you that a perusal of the papers
connected with the withdrawal of the 2nd Battalion Royal Irish Regiment from the field
force on the North-Western Frontier has satisfied the Commander-in-Chief that a grave
injustice was done to the 2nd Battalion Royal Irish Regiment when it was recalled from field
service.</p>

<p class="right">“(Signed) <span class="pad2 smcap">Evelyn Wood, A.-G.</span>”</p>

<p class="p1" />
<p>“Knowing that many present here with these battalions have sons, brothers and other
relations and friends serving in the second battalion, and that also there are many here who
have served in it, he thinks that this will be interesting and satisfying to all.</p>

<p>“The 2nd battalion left Jubbulpore for the front in August last, and when assembled at
Rawal Pindi, all detachments having joined headquarters, was over 800 strong.</p>

<p>“The regiment moved thence by rail to Khasalgurh, from thence by march route to
Hangu, the two last marches (twenty-six miles) being done in one day, guarding a convoy
some five miles long, with the enemy reported as lying in wait to attack, which, however, they
did not do.</p>

<p>“The battalion was detained at Hangu, in the Miranzai Valley for two or three weeks,
and it was in this place, owing to the heat and unhealthiness of the valley, it being the
most unhealthy time of the year, that malarial fever became prevalent, and few escaped
sickness.</p>

<p>“From there the regiment was broken up into detachments, 100 men garrisoning the
friendly village of Shahu Khel, in the Khanki Valley, and 150 being detached to the Kurrum.
These latter, supposed to be sickly or weakly men, averaged twenty-two miles a day for six
days. ‘B’ Company under Captain King, on one occasion marched seventeen miles to meet
and escort back artillery; thirty men, under Lieutenant Potter, volunteered, after three
hours’ rest to march back as escort, which they did, the remainder following a few hours
later, thirty-four miles in one day.</p>

<p>“On September 9th ‘A’ and ‘C’ companies from Hangu, with three native battalions,
marched to Fort Lockhart, escorting a convoy, and in the return march were successfully
engaged with the enemy on Gogra Hill.</p>

<p>“On September 12th the headquarters, 295 strong, took part in the relief of Gulistan, on
which occasion three actions were fought between Hangu and that fort, at Gogra, Saragari,
and Gulistan, the enemy being cleared off the Samana Ridge.</p>

<p>“The headquarters remained at Fort Lockhart awaiting the further advance. No hint
that the regiment was to be sent back reached the ears of any one belonging to it until the
day on which it was published in orders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span></p>

<p>“As soon as he heard of it, the Commanding Officer and Second-in-command at once
interviewed the General, who informed them that the reason of the recall was ‘that the
regiment was saturated with malarial fever.’</p>

<p>“The Commanding Officer, well knowing that at the time sickness had almost entirely
disappeared, asked for a medical board, the result being that the board passed 523 men
as absolutely fit, and above the average in physique. Thirty only were rejected at Fort
Lockhart; most of the remainder were at Kohat and Hangu and were not examined.</p>

<p>“Every effort was made to get the order cancelled, but without avail. The battalion
marched into Rawal Pindi over 700 strong.</p>

<p>“A court of enquiry was applied for, and refused.</p>

<p>“In the end the battalion was ordered back to the front, but too late to take part
in any further important operations. It thus lost the chance of adding fresh laurels to its
name, through no fault of its own.</p>

<p>“It was not long before certain libellous newspaper writers, eager for scandal, commenced
their attacks on the fair fame of the regiment, but no one who knows the material of which it
consisted, men from the counties of Wexford, Tipperary, Kilkenny, and Waterford, ever for
a moment gave credence to their tales.</p>

<p>“No steps have been left untaken to have this great wrong righted. His lordship, the
Commander-in-Chief has given the above decision, and every man who wears or who has ever
worn the uniform of the Royal Irish owes a debt of gratitude to his lordship which can never
be sufficiently repaid for the trouble he has taken in our cause.</p>

<p>“Colonel Lawrence would like to make it known to the battalions here at Kilworth that
he never heard or heard of, a complaint from any one during these operations, though the
heat, hard work, and long marches were particularly trying. On the contrary, the men were
conspicuous for cheery willingness and good temper, and their eager keenness to meet the
enemy.</p>

<p class="pfs90">INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE DEFENCE OF TRAINS, IN ORDERS FOR
DECEMBER 6, 1900.</p>


<p class="pfs80 marg">“The following C. of S. circular memo., No. 25 of Pretoria 27-11-00 is published
for information.</p>

<div class="blockquoty">

<p>1. All officers and men travelling by train on all occasions must be armed.</p>

<p>2. The senior officer travelling on a train is responsible for its defence, if attacked.</p>

<p>3. For this purpose every officer travelling should satisfy himself whether he is the senior
officer on the train or not.</p>

<p>4. The senior officer on the train should see that the men travelling by the train have their
rifles handy, and that one or two men are detailed to keep a look-out.</p>

<p>5. It has lately been noticed that the enemy, when they attempt the capture of a train, ride
up behind the train when it is going slowly up a grade, and detach the vacuum hose
from the rear of the brake-van. They then open fire along both sides of the train, to
prevent any one getting out.</p>

<p>6. To avoid this, a truck is attached to the rear of each train, with the vacuum hose disconnected.
If any troops are travelling on the train, the senior officer should see that
some of them are posted, if possible, on the rear truck.</p>

<p>7. Engine drivers have instructions to blow a long blast on the base whistle, if they have any
reason to think that anything is wrong. Troops should be instructed to stand to arms
on hearing this warning.”</p></div>


<p class="pfs80 marg">In orders of February 22, 1901, appeared the following instructions for officers and men
travelling by train.</p>

<div class="blockquoty">

<p>“1. A commander is to be detailed in each truck in which there are troops.</p>

<p>2. Officers travelling with troops are to be distributed throughout the train: they are not all
to travel together in one truck.</p>

<p>3. The men are to keep their ammunition on, and their rifles beside them. The rifles are
not to be stacked in a corner of the truck.</p>

<p>4. The men in the rear truck are to be mounted as a guard with a sentry, and magazines
charged.</p>

<p>5. The officer in command of the train should enquire of the Commandant or R.S.O. which
are the most dangerous parts of the line and warn all under his command.</p>

<p>6. Goods and bales on the trucks are to be arranged as breastworks as far as possible, in the
rear truck especially.</p>

<p>7. R.S.O.’s are to arrange that these orders are shown to the Commander of every train.
When small parties without an officer or N.C.O. are on the train, he should appoint
one man in charge.”</p></div>

<p class="p1 center"><span class="smcap">Colonel-in-Chief.</span></p>

<p class="center">Field-Marshal The Right Hon. G. J., Viscount Wolseley, K.P., G.C.B., O.M., G.C.M.G.</p>

<p>Garnet Joseph Wolseley, the eldest son of Major Wolseley, 25th The King’s Own
Scottish Borderers, was born on the 4th of June, 1833, and was appointed Ensign in the
80th Regiment on the 12th of March, 1852. He served with that regiment in the Burmese
War of 1852-53 (Medal); he was with the expedition under Sir John Cheape against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
robber chief Myat Toon, and was severely wounded when leading a storming party (Mentioned
in despatches). In this campaign Ensign Wolseley fought shoulder to shoulder with
the men of the 18th Royal Irish, and thus, early in his military career, formed acquaintance
with the regiment of which he was destined to become Colonel-in-Chief, and which has
since served through campaigns in armies under his command.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Wolseley’s next active service was in the Crimea with the 90th Light
Infantry. Landing in December, 1854, he was employed in the trenches as Acting Engineer
until the fall of Sebastopol, and was engaged in the assault and defence of the Quarries on
June 7th, the attack of June 18th, and the sortie of August 30th, when he was severely wounded
(Several times mentioned in despatches, Medal with clasp, Knight of the Legion of Honour,
5th Class of the Medjidie, and Turkish Medal).</p>

<p>Captain Wolseley served through the Indian Mutiny, and was present at the relief of
Lucknow, the defence of the Alumbagh, the siege and capture of Lucknow, the affair of
Baree, and the action at Nawabgungee (Repeatedly mentioned in despatches, promoted to be
Major with Brevet of Lieutenant-Colonel, Medal with clasp).</p>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Wolseley served on the staff of Sir Hope Grant in the war of 1860 in
China, and was present at the assault of the Taku Forts, and in all the other engagements
throughout the campaign (Medal with two clasps).</p>

<p>During service on the staff in Canada, Colonel Wolseley was employed from 1868 to 1870
in dealing with the Fenian raids (Medal with two clasps), and he commanded the expedition
sent in 1870 from Canada to the Red River Territory for the suppression of the Rebel
Government at Fort Garry (K.C.M.G., C.B., Clasp).</p>

<p>Sir Garnet Wolseley was Governor of the Gold Coast and Commander of the Forces
during the Ashanti War of 1873-74. For this service he received the thanks of both Houses
of Parliament, was promoted to be Major-General for Distinguished Service in the Field, and
was awarded the G.C.M.G., K.C.B., and Medal and clasp.</p>

<p>In June, 1879, Sir Garnet Wolseley went to South Africa as Governor and High Commissioner
of Natal; he completed the subjugation of the Zulus, brought the war to an end, and
afterwards overpowered Sekukuni’s forces, and destroyed their stronghold (G.C.B., Medal and
clasp).</p>

<p>Lieutenant-General Sir Garnet Wolseley was Commander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary
Army throughout the Egyptian War of 1882, in which campaign that army in the
space of twenty-five days effected its disembarkation at Ismailia, traversed the desert, fought
the decisive battle of Tel-el-Kebir, and seized Cairo, the capital. He received the thanks

<p>Charles Frederick Gregorie was born on the 25th of November, 1834, and was educated at
Westminster School. He joined the 23rd Royal Welsh Fusiliers in the Crimea on the 16th
of September, 1855, and served there to the end of the war. He was appointed Adjutant of
the Regiment in May, 1857, and embarked with it in the following month at Portsmouth for
China. On arrival at Cape Town, the destination of the Regiment was changed to Calcutta in
consequence of the outbreak of the Indian Mutiny. He was present at the Relief of Lucknow,
by Sir Colin Campbell, in November, 1857; at the defeat of the Gwalior Contingent at
Cawnpore in December, 1857; and at the Capture of Lucknow in March, 1858 (Medal and two
clasps). He was appointed Adjutant of the 7th Rifle Depôt Battalion at Winchester on the 8th
of October, 1861. Major Gregorie exchanged to the 18th Royal Irish Regiment on the 31st of
October, 1871, and succeeded to the command of the Second Battalion on the 14th of September,
1878. He commanded this Battalion throughout the campaign of 1882 in Egypt, and was
present at the action of Kassasin and the battle of Tel-el-Kebir (Mentioned in despatches,
C.B., Medal and clasp, and 3rd class of Medjidie). Colonel Gregorie was appointed in 1883 to
the command of the 35th Regimental District at Chichester, and served there until, on the
17th of November, 1885, he became A.A. and Q.M.G. of the South-Eastern District, and held
this appointment until promoted to be Major-General on the 18th of June, 1890. He commanded
the 1st Infantry Brigade at Aldershot from April, 1891, until his retirement in
December, 1894. He was selected for the Reward for Distinguished and Meritorious Service
in June, 1894. Major-General Gregorie was appointed Colonel of The Royal Irish Regiment
on the 31st December, 1897.</p>

<p>This Memorial, which stands on the north wall of the north transept of St Patrick’s
Cathedral between the China and Burma Monuments, was unveiled on May 24th, 1907, by
Colonel Beauchamp J. C. Doran, C.B., in the unavoidable absence of Lord Wolseley, the
Colonel-in-Chief, and Major-General Gregorie, C.B., the Colonel of the Regiment. The Very
Rev. the Dean of St Patrick’s responded to Colonel Doran’s speech.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span></p>

<p>The Celtic mural Cross, which is nine feet high, is of white marble, laid on a mosaic background,
with a frame of Carlow limestone. It was designed by Sir Thomas Drew, and made
by Messrs Sharp and Emery, of Great Brunswick Street, Dublin.</p>

<p>A brass tablet, mounted on mahogany, is placed below the Cross. It bears the Crest of
the Regiment and the following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p>On the floor, extending along the whole front of the Memorials of China, South Africa,
Egypt, and Burma, is a black marble slab four feet wide, having four Irish Wolf Hounds in
cut stone crouching thereon. Above this is a band of grey dressed stone two feet wide, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
a black marble border along the top. A wide space of the wall above is faced with polished
alabaster, and this is surmounted by a white marble border.</p>

<p>The words CHINA&mdash;S. AFRICA&mdash;BURMA are inset in gold on the black marble slab
opposite the respective Monuments.</p>


<p class="p2 center">V. THE SOUTH AFRICAN WINDOW.</p>

<p>The picture at <a href="#PAT">p. 305</a> shows this Memorial directly in front. The window is a lancet,
thirteen feet high and three feet six inches wide. It was designed by Miss Sara Purser, and
made at her stained-glass works in Pembroke Street, Dublin. The figure in the centre
represents King Cormac of Cashel&mdash;bishop, warrior, and scribe. Miss Purser writes: “He
is standing leaning on his sword, with his warriors behind him; one holds his shield, and
another a banner with a dragon of an interlacing Celtic design. At the top of the window
two angels support his mitre. In a panel at the base, a mourning angel leans over a shield
bearing a badge of the Regiment&mdash;the Lion of Nassau. On a scroll is the Regimental motto&mdash;‘Virtutis
Namurcensis Præmium’&mdash;and the Harp and Crown; the Sphinx and the Dragon
are also worked into the ornament.”</p>

<p>At the bottom of the window is inscribed on the glass:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p1 center fs70 lht2 wsp">
IN MEMORY OF THE OFFICERS, NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS, AND MEN<br />
OF THE ROYAL IRISH REGIMENT WHO FELL IN THE<br />
SOUTH AFRICAN WAR, 1899-1902.</p>

<p>As the Depôt of the Regiment is at Clonmel, in the diocese of Cashel, the choice of the
subject of the window is very appropriate, and Miss Purser has been most successful in
introducing the various regimental devices into the design; the jewel-like colours of the
glass are also admirable.</p>


<p class="p2 center">VI. THE CRIMEAN WINDOW.</p>

<p>This is just visible in the picture to the right of the South African Window. It is a
lancet; at the top is the Harp and Crown, with wreath of shamrocks, and a scroll bearing
the regimental motto. In the centre is a view of Sebastopol Harbour, and at the base an
ornamental design.</p>

<p>All connected with the Regiment, both in the past and the present, who may not have
visited St Patrick’s Cathedral in recent years, will be struck by the vast improvement
lately effected through the rearrangement and artistic grouping of the numerous Regimental
Memorials.</p>

<p>Upon this subject, Sir Thomas Drew wrote on August 20th, 1907: “The real Memorial
work was the collection of the previous Memorials of the Regiment, which were casual and
scattered, and rearranging them with some general regard into a trophy in which the older
Burmah and China monuments of the Pagan and Early Victorian Era were grouped with the
dominant South African Votive Cross. They lent themselves, I thought, very happily to
component parts of one Regimental Memorial of historic interest, to which the North
Transept of the Cathedral is dedicated now. As a whole, and properly photographed, I
could conceive no more effective frontispiece to a book on the Royal Irish Regiment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span></p>

<p>The Very Reverend The Dean of St Patrick’s, in the course of his speech at the ceremony
of the unveiling of the South African Memorial, said: “It is the privilege of the Chapter of
the National Cathedral to be the guardians of many memorials of distinguished Irish regiments.
But with no regiment are our ties so manifold and so intimate as with the famous
regiment which offers us to-day the custody of its Memorial of the comrades who fell in
South Africa. We are surrounded at this end of the North Transept by your insignia and
the memorials of your past. In this place, hallowed by so many memories of gallant men,
it is fitting that you should offer, and that we should welcome, a monument which will recall
to future generations the services which the 1st Battalion of the 18th Royal Irish&mdash;the Royal
Regiment of Ireland&mdash;rendered with faithfulness and devotion for two years and a half
during the last great trial of our arms, the long death-roll&mdash;too long to inscribe on our
walls here&mdash;shows at how great a cost your duty was fulfilled.”</p>

<p class="p2 center">THE SOUTH AFRICAN WAR MEMORIAL, CLONMEL.</p>

<p>The ceremony of unveiling this Memorial was performed at the Barracks, Clonmel, on
October 5th, 1908, by the Marquis of Ormonde, Honorary Colonel of the original 5th
Battalion, now the 4th Special Reserve Battalion, of the Royal Irish Regiment. About
350 men of the 2nd Battalion, under command of Colonel A. S. Orr, D.S.O., travelled from
Buttevant with the band and colours, and formed up on the Barrack Square with the 3rd
Special Reserve Battalion, under command of Major R. O. Kellett.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span></p>

<p>After carrying out the ceremony of unveiling, the Marquis of Ormonde addressed the
troops, and recounted the services of the Regiment during the War in South Africa. He
made special mention of the gallant deed of No. 3733, Private J. Barry, a Kilkenny man, who
was killed at Monument Hill on the night of January 6th, 1901. Private Barry was awarded
the Victoria Cross, and it was given to his widow. Lord Ormonde further alluded to the fine

<p class="p1 pfs90 smcap">Description of the Memorial.</p>

<p><em>Designer</em>&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. Caulfeild Orpen</span>, Esq., B.A., F.R.I.A.I., 13 South Frederick Street,
Dublin.</p>

<p><em>Executants</em>&mdash;Messrs <span class="smcap">C. W. Harrison &amp; Sons</span>, 178 Great Brunswick Street, Dublin.</p>

<p>The Memorial consists of three stone seats, forming a triangle, set on a circular platform,
reached by three broad circular steps. Above the backs of the seats, and filling the space
which they enclose, rises a triangular block of masonry having sunk panels on each of its
faces, the whole being surmounted by a carved stone cornice.</p>

<p>The work is executed throughout in fine selected Irish limestone from the Stradbally
quarries.</p>

<p>The height of the entire structure is fifteen feet, and the sides of the triangle are
eight feet.</p>

<p>The front panel on the triangle bears a female figure executed in bronze in relief. The
figure was designed and modelled by Miss Beatrice Elvery, of Dublin, who also made the
models for the bronze wreaths and escutcheons which surround the Memorial immediately
below the carved stone cornice; the escutcheons show the regimental badges. The two side
panels on the triangle, which correspond in size with the front panel, are filled with the roll
of Officers, Non-Commissioned Officers, and Men who fell in the Campaign.</p>

<p>On the panels behind the three seats the following inscriptions are placed:&mdash;</p>

<p>Front&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent pad6 fs70 lht2 wsp">

preyed upon the merchantmen of southern and western Europe. When they captured a European
ship, the crew and passengers were carried off to Algiers and sold as slaves; if there were women on
board, they were bought for the <em>harems</em> of rich Moors. In 1816 England sent a great fleet to Algiers
and after a very heavy bombardment, effectually crippled the sea-power of its freebooting population.</p></div>

camping ground, where “all manner of necessaries for man and horse awaited them, so that the
soldiers had nothing to do but to pitch their tents, boil their kettles and lie down to rest.” This
admirable system, carefully organised by Marlborough, whose care for his soldiers astonished his
foreign colleagues, naturally came to an end after the army had passed out of the territories of the
Allied Powers: once in the enemy’s country the British troops had to face many hardships.</p></div>

lasted until the nineteenth century. During the great war with France we had in our pay
battalions composed of subjects of every country into which Napoleon had carried his arms.
The Emperor had drafted them into his regiments, and when they were taken prisoners they usually
preferred to earn pay by enlisting in our army to languishing at Dartmoor or in the hulks. Not
unnaturally they showed, as a rule, no great anxiety to meet their former comrades in battle, and
usually found their way to the West Indies as garrison troops.</p></div>

terms existing between the British and French soldiers when they met on outpost. Things seem to
have been much the same in the time of Marlborough, for Millner says that on the night before Malplaquet
“several of both sides had frequent and friendly Commerce and Conferences with one
another, as if we had been in an alliance together; but at last each man being called to his respective
post, our Commerce was turn’d to, and swallowed up in blood, as in the Salutations of the day after
appeared.”</p></div>

After saying that the enemy had carried away all the wheat before the beginning of the siege, he
continues, “but we met with a considerable supply, which I fear will scarce be believed by any but
those that saw it. But fact it is, that the soldiers found concealments under ground, which the mice
had laid up for their winter store, and that in such abundance, that it was a great relief to us toward
the end of the Siege. These hoards were from four to six feet under ground, and in many of them
our men found some pecks of corn.”</p></div>

officially recognised soon after the end of the Seven Years’ War (1763); they were composed of small,
active men, trained to act as skirmishers and in the outpost line. It was the custom to collect the
flank companies of different regiments and turn them into provisional battalions: for instance, in the
attack on the Terra Nova at Namur the grenadier companies of thirteen battalions were detached
from their own corps and brigaded together; and, nearly a hundred years later, both the grenadier
and the light infantry companies of the garrison of Boston were used in the same way at Lexington
and Bunker’s Hill. After the Crimean War flank companies were abolished.</p></div>

Among the deaths appears the name of Lieutenant George Mallet, who died during our occupation of
the island. When the writer of this history visited Elba many years ago, he noticed on the wall of
the garden where Napoleon used to walk during his exile in 1814-15, tablets to the memory of two or
three British officers. One of these bore the following inscription:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
“Near this place lyeth the remains of Lieutenant George Mallett of the 18th or Royal Regiment
of Ireland who departed this life the 13th of January 1797 in the 18th year of his age.”
</p>
<p>
Thanks to the good offices of Mr M. Carmichael, H.M. Consul at Leghorn, and to the kindness of
Lieutenant-General Count Simminiatelli, commanding the troops in Tuscany, this tablet has been
presented to the regiment, and is now at the depôt at Clonmel.</p></div>

the shore, where her crew, passing themselves off as Americans, were claimed by the United States

“left in front.” The XVIIIth must have been very well drilled to be able to do this, for in those days
very few regiments could move otherwise than “right in front.” This innovation is interesting in
connection with the formation of the Royal Irish in the attack on the Dockyard Creek at Sebastopol
on June 18, 1855, described in <a href="#CHAPTER_VII">chapter vii</a>.</p></div>

to realise the needs of the army in the Crimea. The Land Transport Corps was formed by an able
and energetic officer, Colonel McMurdo, “who had so well used his opportunities that horses, trained
drivers, escorts and vehicles were being rapidly assembled and organised. All this demanded a great
outlay, insomuch that on one of the Colonel’s many requisitions, the Secretary to the Treasury, Sir
George Trevelyan, had written, ‘Colonel McMurdo must limit his expenditure.’ When the paper
returned to the Colonel with these words, he wrote below them: ‘When Sir George Trevelyan limits
the war, I will limit my expenditure!’”</p></div>

quick shot and the head disappeared. When the troops got into the works the officer looked for the
man he had hit. The Maori had dropped with a bullet through his brain, but this death-wound was
not his only injury. Some time during the siege his leg had been broken and roughly bound up with
flax and a tent-peg, to enable him to go on fighting. In the retreat a native for some time escorted a
party of women and children. “As his pursuers approached,” says Mr Rusden, “he turned and knelt
down to take deliberate aim. Time after time, without firing a shot, he thus arrested the pursuit
while the women fled. At last he himself was shot, and it was found that his gun was not loaded.”</p></div>

in 1864. In a skirmish the son of a chief was made a prisoner, badly wounded in the leg. To save
his life the surgeons amputated the limb, and when the young man was fit to be moved a message
was sent to his father that he might take the lad back to his village. The chief was very grateful
for the kindness his son had received at our hands; he presented the General with a cartload of
potatoes, and assured him that in future he would not kill any wounded soldiers who fell into his
hands, but would only cut off one of their legs and send the men back to camp!</p></div>

Cross is as follows: “For his gallant conduct at the skirmish near Nukumaru in New Zealand, in
proceeding under a heavy fire with four privates of the regiment who volunteered to accompany him
to within thirty yards of the bush occupied by the rebels, in order to carry off a comrade who was
badly wounded. On the afternoon of that day Captain Shaw was ordered to occupy a position about
half a mile from the camp. He advanced in skirmishing order, and, when about thirty yards from
the bush, he deemed it prudent to retire to a palisade about sixty yards from the bush, as two of his
party had been wounded. Finding that one of them was unable to move, he called for volunteers to
advance to the front to carry the man to the rear, and the four privates referred to accompanied him,
under a heavy fire, to the place where the wounded man was lying, and they succeeded in bringing
him to the rear.”</p></div>

at Clonmel, was riding a cob he had purchased a short time previously from Mr Burke, and racing
at the road fence (a low wall on the inside, but very treacherous on the roadway, as it had been
cut away 9 feet to level a hill) the cob jumped clean on to the road, with a fall outside of 11
feet. The horse never fell, but Mr Vigors fell on the cob’s neck, and slipped off at the far side
of the road, luckily unhurt.”</p></div>

local Intelligence officer, in a curious way. Viljoen had in his service a Kaffir, whose father was
employed by us at Lydenburg. The younger Kaffir overheard Viljoen mention in conversation that
he meant to return to Pilgrim’s Rest on a certain day; and obtaining leave of absence, passed the news
on to his father, who in his turn reported it to the Intelligence department. It seems almost
incredible that Viljoen should have been guilty of such an indiscretion as to talk of his intended
movements within earshot of a Kaffir: but if the account is accurate, it affords another illustration
of the truth of the saying&mdash;“What is rumoured in your camp to-day will be known to-morrow by
the enemy.”</p></div>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
